<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_I._THE"></a> CHAPTER I. THE COMMON BASIS OF
RELIGIOUS LIFE.</h2>
<p>THERE is a well known story of how a man of letters a century ago,
when questioned as to his religious views, answered that all sensible
men were of one religion, and to the further query as to what that
religion might be, made the curt response: "Sir, sensible men never
say." The story is characteristic of its age, and of the attitude
towards religion of some of its ablest men. Many of the greatest
thinkers, whatever the religious opinions of the circle in which they
were educated may have been, held themselves aloof from controversy on
questions of creed and church, looking upon such disputes with the
kindly contempt of tolerant beings who themselves had reached a larger
and freer atmosphere than that which surrounded those who struggled
amid the dust of the plains beneath their feet. Something of this
spirit, which is so clearly manifested in the world of politics and
letters, can be seen too in many of the prominent religious
organisations of the day. Men were weary of the hateful bitterness
which had characterised the theological [p.2] controversies of the
seventeenth century, and the wider outlook which came with the age of
illumination showed itself even as late as the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when in Germany Catholic and Protestant
ecclesiastical authorities united in a common religious celebration at
Fulda of the anniversary of the mission of Saint Boniface. But beneath
the surface of this toleration, which seemed to be increasing between
Catholic, Protestant and Jew, we may perhaps feel that the uniting
influence lay not so much in a profound sense of the underlying
verities common to all their various forms of faith as in a certain
vagueness as to any form of dogmatic belief, a distrust of dogma in
itself, if not an indifference to the things which that dogma
attempted to represent. Men were willing to leave others free to have
their own religious beliefs, and distrusted the enthusiasm of the
fanatic, of the man who wished to convert others to view life as he
himself did. The profession of a recognition of good in all religions
went hand in hand with the recognition of their imperfection, and a
doubt as to how far they were not so much alike sharing in truth as
alike mingled with error. This attitude is illustrated by Lessing's
famous fable of the three rings, which is perhaps the most quoted
passage in "Nathan the Wise." None but the father can tell the true
ring from the counterfeits which he has had made; the sons must
therefore each treat the others as in the same position as himself. No
one creed can claim to [p.3] itself a pre-eminence over the others,
none but God can distinguish the true from the false. The lesson of
tolerance which Lessing taught in his drama was one of which our age,
as well as his own, has need, but if we are only to view all forms of
faith with respect because we are conscious of the difficulty of
discerning the true from the false, we have reached a position which
may indeed promote friendly relationships in the ordinary intercourse
of life, but which cannot in the end be satisfactory either to
ourselves or to others.  Tolerance founded upon doubt can never be an
inspiring virtue.</p>

<p>Is it not possible for us, however, since we realise this, to take
a further step? We need to feel, not the imperfections of all the
varying creeds, religions and irreligions, but the inherent strength
of each, and from a consciousness of this to rise to some dim
realization of the golden thread of truth which runs through all
sincere faiths, however degraded or erroneous they may at first sight
appear to be.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century there swept over Europe a wave of new
thought, which liberated men's minds from old superstitions and the
narrowness of former dogmatism, and produced a sort of freemasonry of
new ideas between men whose national religious and political
upbringing had been wholly different. But this wave of liberal thought
failed to produce a permanent sense of unity; in due time came a
counter-movement when men [p.4] turned from the generalisations and
the vague optimism of these syncretist philosophers. The attacks which
the sceptical critics had levelled on the older creeds were too
negative in character: content to find out the weakness of their
opponents' position and to expose it to contempt and ridicule, they
had failed to realise the strength which lay deeper than the
intellectual interpretations of belief which they had assailed.</p>

<p>Thus the nineteenth century has witnessed in the political world an
extraordinary revival of national spirit, especially amongst smaller
peoples, and on the other hand a similar revival within the different
religious communities. The eighteenth century humanists would have
foreseen the one as little as the other. To them it seemed that
beneath the clear light of reason the old dogmas of the sects would
each lose their force, just as the ignorant patriotism of their day,
which they saw to be so largely built upon mistaken prejudice, would
give away to their wide cosmopolitan spirit which felt itself above
these petty views.</p>

<p>The revival of national feeling among the little peoples of Europe,
with no wealth of capital or military force to give them aid, which we
have witnessed during the last century, is, however, hardly less
remarkable than the revival of life amongst the different Churches and
religious communities of the western world.  There was surely
something lacking in the theory of life of these men of broad view of
a former day who for [p.5] all their breadth could not find room for
enthusiasm such as this.</p>

<p>We are beginning to see that the truer cosmopolitan of the future
will not cease to be a citizen of his own country when he becomes a
citizen of the world, that the wider fellowship will lose its content
and its meaning if it is to involve a denial of patriotism and not
rather to subsume it as a necessary element in the true international
spirit; and so in the inner life of the soul we must seek to harmonize
the various contending creeds, not by destroying any particular creed,
or attempting to replace it by some, vague generalisation, devoid of
life or of attractive and inspiring force, but by attempting to appeal
to the best in each, realising that each must have some value of its
own, just as the poorest of peoples has its own peculiar traits and
virtues; and thus gradually draw the sympathies and thoughts of men
nearer together by reason of the common life from which must spring
all that is good in the religion of each one.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful saying of Penn's which sets forth what many
good men of very different creeds must have felt again and again
before he gave the thought expression: "The humble, meek, merciful,
just, pious, and devout souls are everywhere of one religion; and when
death has taken off the mask they will know one another, though the
divers liveries they wear here makes them strangers."  May we not
venture to carry further the thought and say, that this religion
includes [p.6] every servant of truth, and every man who is
recognizing in practice in his own life the need of his fellows, by
subordinating his own happiness and interest to theirs? That there is
in reality a religion which all good men share we do, indeed,
recognise in practice in everyday life; how else can we explain the
appeal to conscience, to the sense of duty, to the unselfish desire to
benefit others, which is constantly made to men of the most divergent
religious views, whose theories of life would not be accepted by each
other for a moment?</p>

<p>How is it then possible for us to make more clear to our eyes and
to others this common basis of religion, and to build more securely
upon it the structure of our lives?</p>

<p>We must not be disappointed if it is difficult to give intellectual
expression to this basis of life; at best such expression must be
imperfect, and we can only hope to arrive at it very slowly. Perhaps
some hint of the way in which one may look at the problem may be given
by that strange poem of W. B. Yeats "The Indian upon God." The poet
pictures the way in which the creatures of earth each frame their own
idea of the Divine Creator after their own image; some vast Brocken
spectre, perhaps, some may say, cast by the reflection of imagination
upon the clouds of the world without. And yet the poem has surely
within it another meaning. To each creature comes, coloured, it is
true, by different visions, [p.7] some dim picture of the Maker, some
sense of sustaining presence in the world and in their own lives:</p>

<p><em>I passed along the water's edge, below the humid
trees,</em></p>

<p><em>My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my
knees,</em></p>

<p><em>My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl
pace</em></p>

<p><em>All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to
chase</em></p>

<p><em>Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest
speak:</em></p>

<p><em>"Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong and
weak,</em></p>

<p><em>Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky.</em></p>

<p><em>The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from His
eye."</em></p>

<p><em>I passed a little further on, and heard a lotus talk:</em></p>

<p><em>"Who made the world, and ruleth it, He hangeth on a
stalk,</em></p>

<p><em>For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide</em></p>

<p><em>Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals
wide."</em></p>

<p><em>A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his
eyes</em></p>

<p><em>Brimful of starlight, and he said, "The stamper of the
skies,</em></p>

<p><em>He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He</em></p>

<p><em>Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me?
"</em></p>

<p><em>I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say:</em></p>

<p><em>"Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers
gay,</em></p>

<p><em>He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night</em></p>

<p><em>His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of
light."</em></p>

<p>One can readily understand that some readers might be shocked by
what would seem to them to be idolatrous images. Yet does not the
whole poem show something more than the fact that men worship images
of God after their own likeness? Beneath the grossest idolatry there
[p.8] may be at least some sense of contact with the Unseen. Though
man, like his fellow-creatures, cannot behold unveiled the vision of
the Eternal, somewhere under every imperfect picture which our dogmas
have framed of Him does not there lie at least some trait of faint
resemblance? And, however much we may endeavour to remove from our
minds all anthropomorphic conceptions we needs must think as men. Our
most abstract thoughts are but spiritualised metaphors, the ghosts and
shadows of the fully-coloured language of our earlier days or of a
more primitive people. The moment we think of the origin and meaning
of words, we realise that this is so; when we speak of conceiving a
thought, grasping an idea, abandoning an argument, we are using
metaphors which were once bold and vivid but are now scarcely
perceived as such at all. And so in all our formulated thoughts of the
Unseen we may be said to be in a sense idolaters. But only sinfully
so, if we wilfully cleave to the lower forms when we have had vision
of a higher. The fact that we express our thoughts on religion through
the medium of the terms of the material world does not mean that the
religious truths which they express are dependent upon, and are
evolved out of, the physical world, any more than the intellectual
processes of conception and perception are dependent on or derived
from the physical processes after which they are named. But it does
surely mean that we must recognise the necessary [p. 9] imperfection
of our efforts to express the unseen realities, whether in religious
creed or philosophical dogma. If we are convinced that there is a real
unity underlying the religious life of every sincere man, whether he
call himself religious or no, how can we best promote the growth of
this sense of unity, so that in every form of faith the best may be
strengthened and drawn into a sense of membership of a wider
whole?</p>

<p>In the first place we must endeavour to be faithful to the best
ideal of our own party, of our own church or creed, to insist on the
positive side of what it teaches rather than its negations. The true
protestant, for instance, should be zealous to protest for a living
ideal which he feels to correspond to his needs, and not, as too often
has been the case in the past, merely to protest against evils and
mistakes connected with another ideal.</p>

<p>Then realizing the vastness of truth, and the limitations of our
own powers of apprehending it, we must be willing to recognize that
there must be other aspects of truth which we, as individuals or as a
religious community, have not yet apprehended, and that the whole
truth must needs be too great for any human mind or system to
express. This attitude of mind should surely be perfectly compatible
with an enthusiastic loyalty to that vision of the truth which has
been given to us or our community, and with a desire to share this
vision with others. [p.10]</p>

<p>To attempt to surrender our own expression of the Truth as we see
it, and replace it by an expression drawn from the vision of others is
to make in the inner life an error like that of the school of Bologna
in painting. The Caracci and their followers deliberately aimed at
acquiring the peculiar excellencies of each of the great masters who
preceded them, the harmonies of Raphael, the colour of Titian, the
vigour and the grandiose forms of Michael Angelo. They hoped to
combine all these and thus achieve a higher perfection than their
masters, but in so doing they failed to express themselves in their
own way, for they were always painting things as they imagined they
ought to see them, and not as they really saw them.</p>

<p>The great artist, like Rembrandt, will honour and admire a Raphael
or a Correggio without seeking to imitate them or to borrow their
technique. And so while we recognise the vision of truth that comes to
men of different views from our own, we must not abandon our own
vision, or our attempt to express it faithfully, because we know that
we see a part and not the whole.</p>

<p>Every great religious movement has been in its origin or at its
highest point universal in its aspiration, claiming to make appeal to
all mankind and to become at length the religion of the whole
world. And it is this very universal claim which seems to some
dispassionate critics so narrow- spirited and fanatical, which bears
witness to the force and reality of that deepest religious life [p.11]
which underlies all difference of dogma, and finds its expression in
all these varying faiths. At the moment of its budding forth, the tiny
twig feels within it the expanding life of the whole tree. "I am the
true tree, and the tree that is to be."  it may be imagined as saying;
though the great boughs above it do not stir in the wind that shakes
it to and fro. The twig may have within it the possibility of growth
to a size exceeding the stem from which it now springs, or it may
remain only a twig; but in either case it is a part of the tree, and
in a sense it is the tree; its life is the tree's life. So every great
religious movement, when at its best and highest, looks forward to
world-wide extension; it may be that the flood of life takes new
channels and only a tiny sect remains to bear witness to what has
been, but yet, when its members were filled with their first
enthusiasm, and went forth into the world to win others to their
views, they were strong because somehow or other they had come into
touch with the eternal; their creed and organisation may have
corresponded only to the need of the day, and of a limited number of
people, or it may have been of wider application and able to endure
for a longer time, but in spite of these limitations, the creed and
organisation represent an inner life through which their members came
into touch with the source of all life and strength.</p>

<p>Our task then must be to strive to be more conscious of this fact
in our own lives, and [p.12] in elaborating our own systems, as well
as in dealing with and considering the religious views of others. In
discarding the transient elements, the husks of dogma, we have to
respect the seed-corn of life within them. The recognition of this
will make us more reverent towards even the hoary errors of antiquity,
and the methods of thought and life which to us are outworn, but were
once living, and still may be living to some.</p>

<p>This surely is the lesson which we may draw from that touching
story related by John Cassian of the monk Serapion, which Auguste
Sabatier once told to his pupils. In his old age the good monk had
suddenly been brought to realise, by the preaching of two missioners,
the error which he had committed in thinking of the Eternal as a being
like himself, fashioned in human form. His friends gathered round him
to thank God for his deliverance from the grievous anthropomorphic
heresy, when, in the midst of their prayers, the old man fell in tears
to the ground with the pathetic cry: "Woe's me, wretched man that I
am! they have taken away my God and I have none to hold to or worship
or pray to now."</p>

<p>In our work of thought or of practical endeavour we shall need
above all to realise the value of humble reverence for truth for its
own sake, and of the recognition that wherever goodness is, there is
that which the theist knows as the Divine, which others my speak of as
the enduring spiritual [p.13] ideal, but which, by whatever name we
call it is the inspiring and illuminating reality which shines through
every unselfish deed and thought, and makes our lives of worth.</p>

<p>We are sensible of this uniting force, however much our ethical
ideals may differ. We cannot explain the common principles which
justify the ideal of a Gordon and that of a Tolstoy, but we must
surely feel that those ideals are in some way branches from the same
good tree; it may well be that just as in the intellectual world
different bents of genius each have their place and justification, so
too in the moral have different types of the ethical ideal. The
scientific mind, the practical, executive talent of the businessman,
the speculative powers of the metaphysician and the creative gifts of
the poet and artist, each have their place, and no one human mind can
combine them all. So, too, it may be with the moral ideals realised
here in our human lives. Because one is good, another is not wholly
wrong. There may be varieties of goodness just as there are
differences of shape and beauty between flower and flower. But while
we recognise this, we surely need too to realise that there must
ultimately be some vital connection between these different ideals,
although we ourselves may not be able to perceive the unifying
influence or principle. Is it not here that the Union of Ethical
Societies fails, in that after insisting upon "the supreme importance
of the knowledge, love and practice of the Right," [p.14] their
manifesto goes on to disclaim "the acceptance of any one ultimate
criterion of right" as a condition of ethical fellowship? Yet unless
there be some such criterion, can we speak of "the Right" at all? The
capital "R" is an unconscious survival of the theistic expression of
thought, or rather the expression of the essentially religious spirit
of man, which in spite of a creed of intellectual agnosticism,
recognises the Divine in life and does obeisance to it under another
name. The idea of good and the thought of God are not connected
together merely by a similarity of sound; they have but one
origin. Thus, if where goodness is, there God is, we must be able to
find evidence, even where there may be no intellectual knowledge of
God, of the recognition of a unique worth in the good apart from all
attempted explanations of its value. And perhaps we cannot do better
than take an example from the writings of a master sceptic, to show
how in spite even of an apparent intention to make mock of the failure
of the good and unselfish man, and of the utterly impracticable nature
of his ideal, a kind of homage is yet paid to the ideal and to its
votary, and through them to the source of their inspiration.</p>

<p>Readers of Voltaire's "Candide" will recall the figure of the
Anabaptist Jacques, the upright and unselfish man who perishes in
spite of all his trust in overruling good. Voltaire in picturing his
death would appear to be casting scorn upon [p. 15] a complacent view
of a universe where such a thing might happen again and again, and as
far as any practical teaching goes he would seem merely to point out
that righteousness and faith may be not only unavailing to ward off
calamity, but may actually bring it upon those who make such a
standard their sole guide. And yet, even as you read, you feel how
much nobler and better it is to perish like Jacques, with the
unswerving faith of a good man, than to live on contentedly digging
one's garden and enjoying its fruits in selfish peace. And however
much we may be conscious that in the moment of trial, face to face
with mortal peril, we ourselves might swerve aside, might hesitate and
fail, we yet know that if we could make our choice in a cool hour,
reviewing calmly what we ought to do, and what we would do if we could
be true to the best that is in us, we should choose the honourable
failure of the good man rather than the success of the bad. In itself
we know it to be better, apart from all thought of consequence. And in
practice we know how in the presence of the loveliness of an unselfish
act all lower thoughts of pleasure and of profit fade away! Face to
face with the enduring ideal that shines forth from. the good deed,
lower ideals shrivel and sink into nothingness. Even truer is this of
goodness made real to us in personality, and here it is that those of
us who call ourselves Christians may find the keystone to the
continual self-revelation of God to man, in that supreme revelation of
the Divine [p.16] nature in the unique personality of Jesus, which for
the Church is the centre of inspiration and the explanation of the
light which shines in all other lives.</p>

<p>If we can unite in reverencing the good and unselfish spirit,
wherever it manifests itself in human lives, so too, we need to
reverence every- where the search after truth, and the service of
Truth for its own sake. Surely one of the most helpful signs our age
is found in this increasing recognition of spiritual kinship between
seekers after Truth of most divergent creed; not the least of the
benefits of the Higher Criticism and the problems with which the minds
of men have been confronted through the advance of science has been
that in the readjustment of thought and life which is going on all
about us, men have grown aware that they are not fighting their
battles alone, but that far and near are kindred spirits going through
a like struggle, and even that those whom they had fancied foemen were
really their allies. This is the beginning of a movement wider and
deeper than the so-called religious controversies which embitter the
surface of our political life, the prelude to a new and wider
Catholicism of the spirit, in which all the servants of Truth and
humanity may unite without sacrifice of conviction in a sense of true
brotherhood. Something of this underlying unity is recognised both in
the supreme moments of our individual lives and in great times of
national crisis, such as [p.17 ] come in the birthpangs of a new
movement or the brave endeavour to stem some rising tide of evil. Thus
it came about that in the great uprising of German democracy of 1848,
the colours which symbolised the new hopes of the people were often
consecrated by a public religious ceremony in which all faiths united,
and in the little Bavarian town of Furth, the Jewish Rabbi, as
representing the smallest denomination of the town, was by common
consent chosen to perform the ceremony. But we do not need to go so
far back or to such a distant place to find instances of the way in
which men of varying creed have found themselves uniting with those
who are opposed to all forms of religion in defence of some common
cause, inspired by some uniting ideal, though but dimly realized.
Here, surely, is the truest test of that which is Catholic, the
<em>quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</em>, which the dogmas
of theology can but imperfectly explain, but which is realized even
now by all who seek to serve whole-heartedly the truth, and therefore,
too, their fellowmen.</p>

<p>There remains a further practical question to be faced. If we
recognise that the good finds expression in various ways, that men in
act and thought alike may differ from each other, and yet the inner
source of their spiritual life may be the same, are we to abandon the
endeavour to find some intellectual synthesis of their divergent
ideals? Must we cease to attempt to express [p.18] in terms of thought
that which we recognize as transcending all human thought and much
more our imperfect terms? Surely this would be a mistake. Though not
only for our own lives but for the whole life of humanity upon the
earth it should prove that our processes of creed building and church
making are necessarily imperfect, we must still for ever strive to
express in thought and in act the life of the spirit, which grows and
deepens as it is faithfully expressed.  Creed and deed alike, we feel,
are but the raiment of the life; they fade and are outgrown, yet they
are not to be fiercely torn to pieces or lightly thrown aside. Even
though we may never hope to be able to explain to ourselves or to
others the common basis of our ethical ideals and of our religious
life, we must never cease to try to find some explanation and to give
what expression to it we can.</p>

<p>The vision of truth that we have now, our intellectual expression
of our relationship to the world, and of our duty in it, is we
recognise, imperfect; it is no key to the universe, to unlock every
mystery for us, still less for others; but it may prove a sufficient
lamp, and one whose rays grow ever brighter, to light our footsteps
onward or (to change the metaphor) it may be a clue to the great
labyrinth about us which may be of use to others besides ourselves,
though some may come to the goal by a very different way. Certainly
the experience of all the great mystics would [p.19] seem to show that
as we ascend the Heavenly mountain, one from one side, one from
another, our paths draw nearer to each other, and so across the night
between, we may listen to our fellow pilgrims' voices, and realize
that some day we shall meet face to face.</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_II._THE"></a> CHAPTER II. THE INNER LIFE OF THE
CHURCH</h2>
<p>IT is difficult for us, and some may even feel that it is
impossible, to make an impartial survey of an institution of which we
ourselves form a part; on the other hand, it is equally difficult,
unless one can realize something of its life from the inside, to
appreciate the real nature of that life. And thus it must ever be
peculiarly hard for us to understand the true relationship of the
Christian churches to the world in which they work and to the ideal
which guides them. And yet as we seek to see the difficulties others
feel, and to enter into sympathy alike with the critic without and the
workers within, we may come near at least to understanding some
portion of the truth. It may remain true that "all we have power to
see is a straight staff bent in a pool," but as we endeavour to clear
our minds and hearts of prejudice and to use others' eyes as well as
our own, the pool grows clearer and the reflection becomes less
broken, and more nearly an image of the reality it represents.</p>

<p>To see the failure of the Church does not mean that we ignore its
victories: but if we are to carry [p.21] those victories further, it
must be by noting our shortcomings, and all that we have not
achieved. Looking out upon the life of men to-day, we cannot forget
how, bad as it is, society has been again and again in large measure
redeemed and kept alive through lives that have been the light and
strength of the Church as well as of the world, but this need not
prevent us from seeing how far the Church as a whole has failed to act
in the same way.</p>

<p>Organised Christianity to-day in England, as represented in the
churches, is very largely a middle class institution. Not only the
very rich, but the great mass of the poorer workers, stand aloof from
it. It has not given its strength to prophesy against the evils that
attack our social life; and to remedy above all that utter separation
of the lives of rich and poor, employer and employed, which is the
terrible characteristic of twentieth-century urban civilisation.</p>

<p>There is much religious "activity," of a limited kind, using old
and recognised channels of expression, and an earnestness in defence
of particular religious views or in attacking particular errors of
doctrine or forms of worship. But if we can for a moment forget our
own individual standpoint and endeavour to look from the point of view
of an outsider upon such religious enthusiasm as shows itself upon
different sides in , let us say the present education controversy. we
shall surely feel that if this represents the life of the churches,
they [p.22] are far indeed removed from the spirit of their
Founder.</p>

<p>"I love to see these Christians fight," was the remark of one able
critic as he left a room where a public body had been engaged in
discussing some phase of the "religious difficulty" in education. It
is true that such a charge is no new one; as far back as the middle of
the second century the philosopher Celsus brought a like one against
the Christians of his day. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title="">[1]</a> But since those early days too, there has been
continual protest within the Church against this very spirit, and it
has been in that series of protests that some, perhaps, may trace the
true apostolic succession of teachers and guides. Age after age these
leaders have found new help and inspiration as they turned toward the
source from which the strength of the Church first sprang, and it is
noteworthy that now, as often in the past many of the men who are
estranged from the Church have nothing but respect &mdash; nay, often
reverence &mdash; in their thought of Christ and of these followers of
His. They would have very different thoughts of Christianity if all
who profess and call themselves Christians had realised that ideal of
the meaning of the name by which they are [p.23 ] called which William
Penn once expressed in the words, "To be like Christ, then is to be a
Christian."</p>

<p>If only we had all more clearly before us that vision, we could not
but be filled not merely with burning shame at our own failure, but
with longing to be more helpful to our fellows, and to draw nearer to
them, as we would grow nearer to our spirit. And this desire within us
will surely be strengthened as we turn towards that wonderful
reflection of His teaching gathered together for us in the closing
chapters of the Gospel of John. In that unique picture of the mind and
heart of the Master there are traits over which we some- times pause
and wonder; sayings which, when we can free our eyes from the scales
with which custom has covered them, seem to shine with a light
brighter than we can bear. And in that chapter, in which we listen as
silent witnesses to the great charter of futurity, the prayer of the
Founder for His Church that is to be, there are words which are so
full of lofty purpose that we hesitate to apply them to our lives;
unconsciously, perhaps, we have been wont to read them over and treat
them as metaphor, meant to inspire but not to be realized; and
gradually we have lost hold of their true significance, the inner life
of thought beyond them.  How truly can we say that we have realized,
as individuals or as a Church, this picture which that prayer gives us
of the Master's aim and desire for us? [p.24]</p>

<p>"And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I
come to Thee. Holy Father, keep them in Thy name which Thou hast given
me, <em>that they may be one, even as we are</em>. . . .  Neither for
these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on Me through
their word; <em>that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in
Me, and I in Thee,</em> that they also may be one in us: <em>that
the</em> <em>world may believe that Thou didst send Me</em>."</p>

<p>So lofty is the thought that one may wonder whether, if these words
had not come down to us as they have done, and some later Christian
mystic had dared to utter this as his ideal, he would not have been
treated as a madman or a heretic. It is hard to think of what it
means: a unity of Christians one with another, even as there is unity
between the Divine Father and the unique Son.</p>

<p>In the bygone days of scholastic theology men might have gone on to
unfold the meaning of this by showing how unity of substance did not
remove the difference of person; But these thoughts do not live for us
to-day as for our forefathers. We must seek to find the meaning of
Christ's union with the Father, not by the road of medieval
metaphysics, but by some method which may appeal to our moral
consciousness.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that Christ is most truly revealed to us as in
unity with the Father in his identification of himself with suffering
and degraded humanity, as most truly Divine when he eats with
publicans and sinners, pours out his strength [p.25] for the sick and
suffering, and his life for those who have rejected him and at best
have misunderstood him?</p>

<p>The Church, then, is most likely to attain to that inward unity for
which her Founder prayed by following the guidance of his life.  She
will be most like him in laying upon herself and claiming as her own
the sufferings and evils that befall or should befall, men in the
world without; least like him and least likely to attain this Divine
unity when she claims rights and privileges for herself, when she
insists on her superiority, when she turns from her the publican and
sinner, or leaves them to meet the punishment which is their due.</p>

<p>The union of Christians with each other is to be witness to the
world of the Divine mission of Jesus. Men are to believe on him
because they see how his life and spirit hold together communities
with differing organisations and men of widely varying personality.
The union is not to destroy personality or variety of character, but
to underlie all difference. It is no external machinery to unite us in
a single visible organisation by which individuality would be stamped
out or fettered in growth. There is little trace of any such machinery
in the earliest history of the Church, and the ages and places where
it has been most perfect have not been those which we think of as
nearest in spirit to Christ, nor those men most like Him whose lives
have been spent merely in the development of such organisation. [p.26
]</p>

<p>Perhaps the only one of the first group of disciples who possessed
powers of organisation was Judas Iscariot; and some critics may say
that he at least has had an apostolic succession of followers
throughout the history of the Church. One remembers the terrible
saying of Renan <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title= "">[2]</a>:
L'histoire de l'Eglise sera le plus souvent désormais l'histoire des
trahisons que subira l'idée de Jesus; and though no churches have been
dedicated to SS. Ananias and Sapphira, they have become in practice
the patrons of too many Christian lives. But if we cannot wish for an
external unity such as that for which many good men plead, we have,
nevertheless, constantly to strive after a deeper union of spirit in
the service of our fellows, in the search after truth, in love to our
Lord.</p>

<p>First let us take our need of sincerity. Perhaps nothing so holds
many men of to-day from Christ as the sense of the insincerity of
those who call themselves Christians. Our worship, our hymns and
prayers, are full of unreality; we persuade ourselves, perhaps, that
we still believe in dogmas which have ceased to have any influence
upon our lives. We shut our eyes to new truths because we are really
afraid to be free, and what was the chalice of a new truth to our
fathers becomes a poison-cup to us and our children. If the Church is
to regain and to retain the respect of honest thinkers we must welcome
fair-minded inquiry wherever it be directed, and not fear to open our
eyes to the sun.  [p.27]</p>

<p>And it is not only intellectual sincerity in accepting new truths
that is needed; if the old truths are to be made real to our day, we
must be prepared to translate them into language which people can
understand. It is worse than useless often to attempt to hand them on
in the garments of old words by which they were clothed in former
days, for as truth is a living thing, and words fade and lose their
meaning, the form in which it is rightly expressed must change from
age to age. It is not enough, then, to repeat some passage of
Scripture, some familiar verse of religious poetry, or some words of a
man of God of former days, to bring help to men to-day, even though
the words are full of meaning to us because we have entered into the
inward experience which they represent. Some have heard the words so
often that they are now almost meaningless; others cannot be touched
by a mode of thought which was the outcome of another time. They need
the truths that lie behind the old words and the outworn methods of
thinking, but they must be re-expressed if they are to reach them.</p>

<p>The eternal realities of which the New Testament writers had hold,
which filled their souls and made them struggle with words and
metaphors to express some glimpse of what they felt, could never be
completely represented by any language. Yet we have taken the words of
the Scripture and treated them as though they were so many phials of
truth in solution. The exquisite flowers of love and [p.28] faith have
been crushed and bruised in the mortar of the theologians to produce
the infallible dogmas of our orthodoxy. But the inward life does not
live upon the abstractions of the theologian any more than our outward
life upon the compressed drugs of the chemist, however perfect the
process of their making may have been. Cannot we, then, honestly
confess that our dogmas are but imperfect human attempts to fathom the
deep things of God, symbols that stand for something which transcends
them as much as the mother's face surpasses the poor drawing which her
child may make of it? Such a drawing can only be understood by the
eyes of love, and we need the same spirit to make our dogmas full of
meaning.</p>

<p>It is not only in intellectual matters that the Church has been
insincere. Many who are no thinkers feel that she has not honestly
attempted to carry out her own teachings. "Blessed are the gentle,"
"Blessed are the poor in spirit," are explained in many a commentary,
but illustrated by too few lives. Yet the only adequate commentary on
the beatitudes is the life of a real follower of Christ.</p>

<p>The fact is that many Christians think that by bowing down in
worship before Christ they are His followers, forgetting His own test
for such: "Why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?" We write of Him, it may be, as Our Lord with capital letters,
when He is not our lord at all, nor the master and controller of our
lives. [p.29] There is a great deal of false reverence about this
lip-worship of phrase and form that actually keeps us from getting as
near as we might to the true spirit of followers of Christ.</p>

<p>If we are lovers and followers of the truth as Jesus bids us be, we
must recognise our kinship and comradeship with all others who
sincerely seek the truth, even though they may attack us and fail for
the moment to see all the light which may shine in our eyes so
clearly: in the mere search after truth their souls are turned towards
the light and unconsciously fed and aided by the Source of all truth!
Nor must we think of them our blind brothers merely, for they may be
fighting a far greater army of foes than we, placed as out-posts of
the hosts of God, surrounded by the enemy and overborne themselves for
a while, that afterwards the victorious ranks of their comrades may
press on over their bodies to conquests of which we have not even
dreamed.</p>

<p>And how far have we failed in unity with our Master and each other
through our not having learnt His lesson of the way of service, of our
true relationship to our fellows?</p>

<p>Yet here and there across the pages of history shines the light of
a good life pointing us the true way, and how by losing ourselves we
find ourselves.</p>

<p>The bearing of the Cross which Jesus enjoined upon His followers is
far other than that asceticism which monk and nun and Puritan have
wasted many a precious life to attain. We have not to give [p.30] up
the pleasant thing because it is pleasant, or because it gives only a
mundane and transitory joy. Joy is good, and not to be avoided, but
welcomed. We have to give up the pleasant thing ourselves, others may
take it in our stead; or give up a large measure of it that they may
share it with us. We do not lose the joy, or pretend that it is unreal
and transitory as the monk may.  It is very real, and we feel it in a
sense we could not do before, because our fellows share it or have it
in place of us, and our life is their life. Gladness which they feel
we must feel too.</p>

<p>This is the difference between the monk of the desert and Francis
of Assisi, the apostle of the joy of Christ . The monk battles with
himself to maintain his vow of poverty; he is constantly giving up in
not possessing things for himself, or in renouncing pleasures which
attract him. St. Francis in possessing nothing has all things, for all
are God's and his fellows', and he is theirs. The wide world is his
cloister, and everything which he can do to gladden his brother gives
joy to himself. True Christianity like his is full of an infectious
sense of the joy of life. Whenever such men go there comes to others
some touch of their spirit, as crumbs drop from a full table.</p>

<p>This faith that joy in itself is good does not mean that there may
not be needful for us all some form of true asceticism, training in
withholding from things good in themselves and from pleasures we
desire, quite apart from the surrendering [p.31] of them to
others. But needful as this is, it is good only as training for an end
beyond itself, and not for the mere sake of abstinence.  We refrain
that we may be masters of our wills, that we may keep control of
habit, that our bodies may be the instrument of our spirits; such
fasting as this only fits us more fully for the joy of service.</p>

<p>Deeper even than the sacrament of joy is that of sorrow, and we may
learn something of it from John Woolman, the Quaker apostle of
Christ's sufferings. Where men suffered he suffered too in spirit with
them. When he came on his last journey to England he could not travel
in the comfortable cabin because of the needless toil of the workmen
that had gone to adorn it, but must share with the poor sailors the
foul air and discomfort of the steerage. And when on the stormy
passage across the Atlantic he lay there sick and in pain, his heart
went up in thankfulness that he was permitted to share the experience
which so many of his fellow-men had to go through, and be united thus
to suffering humanity. "I was now desirous," he tells us, "to embrace
every opportunity of being inwardly acquainted with the hardships and
difficulties of my fellow-creatures, and to labour in His love for the
spreading of pure righteousness on the earth." Then we shall remember,
too, that beautiful passage near the close of his journal, where he
recalls the vision that came to him in time of sickness of that mass
of dull, gloomy colour, made up of [p.32] human beings in as great
misery as they could be and live, and how he was told that he was
mixed with them and henceforth might not consider himself a separate
being. The angel's song, "John Woolman is dead," sounded to him more
pure and lovely than any he had ever heard before, for in truth his
old will was dead, and in him the spirit of Christ was alive.</p>

<p>Is it not here that the Church will find the way to reconcile the
world of toilers and sufferers estranged from her to-day?  &mdash; in
that unity between her members which goes deeper even than membership,
in a love to Christ which shows itself, as He calls for it, towards
all who have need of Him, which identifies the Christian with his
brothers, the doers and bearers of wrong?</p>

<p>As we look out upon a Christendom divided by sects and creeds into
a score of different bodies, we may be saddened by the lament which
many a devout lip has uttered over the schisms which rend the mystic
robe of the Master. But it was only His outer garments which the
soldiers rent asunder: the seamless robe is unsevered still.  External
separation does not touch the spirit of love and true communion which
beneath countless outer differences unites together the lives of all
who follow Him in deed and in truth. And as we each draw nearer to
Him, and His life flows into our lives, we must draw nearer to each
other and to all our fellow-men.</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_III._"></a> CHAPTER III. THE PROPHET IN THE
CHURCH.</h2>
<p>FOR the individual and the community alike the deepest influences
are expressed in life rather than words, yet it remains true that
through the symbols of spoken thought life must again and again come
to expression. In former days this was realised in the value set upon
prophecy, if we may use the word in its broadest and highest sense, as
the forth-telling, in the language of human thought, of the Divine
will present behind our lives and at work amid the world.</p>

<p>One of the changes that strike one most in organized Christianity
to-day, compared with the Church of earlier times, is the general
absence of prophecy in this sense, in all but very occasional
crises. The prophetic instinct is not dead indeed, but men find its
highest manifestations rather outside the Church of earlier times. The
leaders of the Church have been too often content to repeat the
messages of the prophets of a former day rather than to seek for a
living voice within their midst. Yet those who know anything of the
life of the Church from within, judged not merely by this incomplete
[p.34 ]expression, but seen as it affects the daily lives of countless
men and women, must surely agree that in spite of all the trammels of
convention and tradition the Church has still a life to pass on and a
message to deliver for the needs of to-day. Those who would have it
become once more the school of the prophets will surely be willing to
look for a few moments at the picture which has come down to us of
what place prophecy filled in the Church life of the earliest days,
and how the prophet was supplanted, not killed, as some have thought,
by the priest, but rather silenced by the iron grip of
organization.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians
is preserved for us a picture the meetings of an early Christian
Church, full of interest to the historian.</p>

<p>It is clear from this description that an important part was
usually taken in these gatherings by men who gave to their fellow
worshippers what they believed to be God's message or revelation to
them. This was something quite distinct from the recitation of a hymn
or a passage of Scripture, or from the interpretation of scripture, or
again from the teaching of doctrine. It is regarded by the Apostle
Paul as the highest spiritual gift, one earnestly to be desired,
although it was not given to all, but only to some. Of the nature of
this ministry we get a glimpse in his description of the way in which
an unbeliever who enters the assembly is convinced by it. [p.35] The
ministry goes to his inmost self, reading the needs of his heart.</p>

<p>"If all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one
unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: and thus are
the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his
face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a
truth.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

<p>The message of prophecy is one, as it seems, which reaches the
subconscious self of the incomer, who suddenly beholds the realities
of his own inner life in this flood of light that flows in upon him,
piercing through the veil that custom and convention had wrought about
him. But the prophetic word does not merely give this fuller knowledge
of his own nature to the stranger; it puts him also into touch with a
higher self. He sees in a flash of revelation not only the evil in his
own life, but the source of power to set it right, here in the midst
of this assembly, and bowing himself before it he confesses the Divine
Presence.</p>

<p>If we ask how this prophetic ministry is conceived as coming to
those who exercise it, it would seem from the words of the Apostle
that it is not by exercise of the intellect that prophecy comes,
though the understanding is to be cultivated in connection with
another highly prized gift, that of teaching. But the Corinthians are
urged to long after the gift of prophecy most of all; they [p.36] are
to prepare themselves for it, then, by prayer, the door through which
our life opens out into the Divine life and is fed from it. The
teacher thinks over what he knows of the needs and difficulties of his
fellows, ponders over the truths that have been made clear to him in
the past, searches amongst the sayings of the Lord, the teachings of
the Apostles, the words of the Law or the prophets of old, for help
for the present. Not so the prophet. He may, indeed, go through all
this preparation of thought, but the essential preparation for his
work is prayer; prayer in which he must be willing to lay aside, if
need be, all these thoughts of this. The prophetic spirit reaches out
to realize the condition of those to whom it is to minister, and
upward in search of light and strength from its only source.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is not given to the prophet to reach conscious hold of
Him by whom we are all upheld, and then all his ministry may be but a
cry for help, with a deep sense of need. Sometimes he feels the
presence very near, and as he keeps close to the Father's hand, those
about him are given to feel it too.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, some word of the Lord, or some thought of other days
is suddenly illumined by a fresh light, and his message is to hand on
the fire from the altar, that those about him may light their torches
too.</p>

<p>The prophet is God's spokesman. He must lose thought of himself in
his message. He is [p.37] translating for others and to others in the
presence of the Giver of the message. He must keep in touch with those
to whom he is speaking. He must remember too how easy it is for
interpreters to expand and embroider upon the original, and thus to
mar it. And, therefore, the prophet should keep very close to the
Giver of the message, who may have given to others its fuller
exposition.</p>

<p>One danger of the prophets of Corinth was very present to St.
Paul's mind.</p>

<p>Some of them seem to have got so wrapt up in a sense of the Divine
communion that they did not keep that control of their whole nature,
which would lead them to find expression in the language of
intelligence. Carried away by their feelings they gave utterance to
the experience of their spirit in words broken and unintelligible, the
channels of word and thought over which their brains had control
seemed too small for the flood of emotion which swept out in
overmastering power, so that their tongues moved and they spoke
without knowing what they said. Paul knew better than any of them the
hidden things of the Spirit, the groanings that cannot be uttered, the
thoughts that flash upon us and cannot be caught up by our halting
reason, following slowly after, the striving of the soul that no words
can compass, the God-given intuitions which cannot be imprisoned in
words.</p>

<p>But he knew too that language was given us not for the joy of
expressing what we feel but as [p.38] a means of sharing our
experience with others. To speak with an unknown tongue, to abandon
oneself to the ecstasy of the moment, may be right for our own life,
he writes, but it is useless for our fellows. We must not be content
to soar up ourselves into the world of life and light, we must try to
bring back into our world of sense some symbols of the truths of the
world beyond, imprisoning in words which men may understand fragments
of the truths which can never wholly be expressed in words.</p>

<p>At times the message burns so within the prophet's breast that he
feels he must speak, no matter what is happening about him. Thus it
seems that sometimes at Corinth two or three prophets would speak at
once, and mar each other's messages. But this was to lose sight of
their true place, to forget that the message was given them that
others might receive it.</p>

<p>The prophet, he writes, is still master of his own spirit: he is
not to allow his reason to lose its right control. He has to use his
intelligence in deciding when he is to speak and when he must hold
silence. He has not to let his conscious self be submerged in the
sub-conscious, like an island beneath the waves of the surrounding
sea; rather is he to gather on to its dry land the goods the waves
have brought him, before he sends them forth again to other shores. In
this way may the Divine message not only bring help to him but comfort
to all to whom it is sent. [p.39] Thus the picture of the Church of
Corinth and St. Paul's advice for its needs is one to which men may
look who are seeking to-day for that true prophetic ministry which
seemed to the Apostle the most important of the gifts of the Spirit to
the Christian Church.</p>

<p>It may help us too to consider how far that gift has been present
throughout the succeeding ages, and how far it has been hindered by
the Church from finding its true exercise.</p>

<p>When next we get a glimpse of the Church at Corinth, more than a
generation has passed away, and probably few of those who were members
when St. Paul wrote are still alive. The majority of the church is in
disagreement with its Elders or Bishops, and has deposed them from
their positions; and the Bishop of Rome, Clement writes in the name of
his church, in reply to some letter from the Corinthians, to urge them
to be reconciled, and give once more the honour that is their due to
these worthy presbyters. The first epistle of Clement is a long and
beautiful letter, and enters with tact and deep concern into a
discussion of the dissension that is troubling the peace of the
Corinthians, but it makes no mention whatever of the place of prophecy
in the Church. The word prophet does occur twice in the epistle, but
only in reference to the Old Testament.</p>

<p>At the same time it is clear that Clement is very sensible of the
importance of the position of [p.40] the bishops or presbyters, though
it is not quite clear whether these are wholly distinct
offices. Apparently the Church at Corinth was trying, in the spirit of
Greek democracy, to dispense with its church officers. Clement tells
them <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> how the
Apostles went about setting up bishops and deacons amongst the first
fruits of their converts in different cities; these offices had even
been foreseen ages before, he notes, by the prophet Isaiah
(Ix. 17). <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a></p>

<p>It was not right, he urges, that men who had been appointed by the
apostles and afterwards by other men of renown, with the consent and
approval of the whole Church, who had fulfilled their duties without
blame, should now be cast out of their offices.</p>

<p>If we turn to another group of letters, written some twelve years
later by Ignatius of Antioch, on his way to martyrdom at Rome, we
find, again, that the only references to prophets and prophecy deal
with old Testament days, but that the greatest importance is set by
Ignatius upon the relations of the Church to its Bishop: "Do all of
you," he bids the Church of Smyrna, <a href= "#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
title="">[6]</a> "follow the Bishop, as Jesus Christ the Father, and
follow the College of Presbyters as the Apostles, and give heed to the
deacons as God's commandment.  Let no man do anything of those things
that appertain to the Church apart from the Bishop. Let that Eucharist
be accounted valid that is under the authority of the Bishop or of him
to whomsoever he himself entrusts it. Wheresoever the Bishop appeareth
there let the multitude be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is there
is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful apart from the Bishop either
to baptise or to hold an Agape, but whatsoever he approves that is
also well pleasing to God; that all that is done may be safe and
valid." (According to present Catholic doctrine even a woman may
validly baptize.)</p>

<p>We see at once that it would not be easy to fit into such an
ordered Church as this prophets like those of the earliest Church in
Corinth.</p>

<p>But while in most of the larger towns the churches had been
developing along lines like these it would seem that at the same time
there were out of the way places in which a much more primitive
tradition was preserved.</p>

<p>We can get some idea of this from the passages in the Didache which
refer to prophets and travelling apostles.</p>

<p>Two whole chapters of this ancient book of teaching (xi. and xiii.)
are devoted to this subject, whereas only the briefest mention is made
of bishops and deacons, and in these words, "Elect then for yourselves
bishops and deacons, worthy of the Lord, men gentle and not money
loving, true and tested, for they too themselves offer to you the
service of the prophets and teachers; [p.42] "Despise them not then,
for these are they who are honoured of you along with the prophets and
teachers."</p>

<p>Thus it would seem that the bishops and deacons are chosen by the
Church for its work, perhaps in default of sufficiency of prophets and
teachers, to do the work which these would do, and they seem at least
to need, in the writer's eyes, to be supported by an appeal which he
would not think of making on behalf of the prophet and teacher whose
messages carry within themselves their authority. That the true
prophet stands, in his eyes, above the human ordering of the church,
seems clear too, from the section which gives instructions as to the
words (and very beautiful words they are too) of the eucharistic
prayer (ch. x.). At the conclusion of this model prayer the writer
adds: "but allow the prophets to offer thanks as much as they
choose."</p>

<p>Warning of almost naive simplicity is given against dangers from
false prophets. Apparently the temptation to emotional enthusiasm is
not before the writer's mind, as it was before Paul's in writing to
Corinth. The travelling evangelist, or apostle, as he is called, is to
be received "as the Lord," but if he stay for as long as three days he
is to be recognised as a false prophet. The readers are warned not to
judge the prophet who speaks in the spirit, this being treated as the
sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"But not every man who speaks in the spirit [p.43] is a prophet,"
the writer goes on," but only if he have the ways of the Lord," thus
making the character of Christ the objective standard by which
prophets are judged.</p>

<p>"From their ways then shall the false prophet and the prophet be
known, and every prophet who appoints a feast in the spirit does not
eat of it, unless, indeed, he be a false prophet, and every prophet
who teaches the truth, if he does not do that which he teaches, is a
false prophet." The readers are warned against judging the prophet who
does some strange symbolic act for the edification of the Church
without bidding others to do as he does," for even thus also did the
ancient prophets." "But whoso saith in the spirit Give me money, or
any other things, to him ye shall not hearken; but if he speak
concerning others who are in need, and bids men give, let no man judge
him" (ch. xi.). The true prophet who is willing to settle amongst them
is worthy of his keep, they are told, and so is the true teacher; "and
so," the writer continues, "ye shall take every first- fruit of the
produce of your wine-press and threshing floor, of your oxen and of
your flocks, and shall give to the prophets, for they are your high
priests.</p>

<p>"But if ye have not a prophet give to the poor; and so likewise
with bread, oil and wine, with</p>

<p>money, clothes and all other things" (ch. xiii.).</p>

<p>Here we have, perhaps, the hint of a transitional stage between the
early church of Corinth and the churches of Clement and Ignatius. The
prophet [p.44] has the first place of honour and next to him the
teacher but all churches have not their prophet, and in these bishops
and deacons must act in the place of prophets and teachers, and be
honoured as such, while in other churches the prophets and teachers
were treated as a sort of Christian priest, and one may see how their
work came to be regarded as a regular church office and gradually
assimilated, in church after church to the offices customary in the
larger congregations like Rome and Antioch. As time passes the place
of the prophet is more and more taken by the bishop, and by the end of
the second century it would seem, that, for such a bishop of the
Church Catholic as Apollinaris of Hierapolis, the prophet was a memory
of the distant past.</p>

<p>The Montanist movement in Phrygia had owed its strength to the
appeal which it made to the prophetic tradition and the prophetic
spirit. In the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the Phrygian convert Montanus
had gone into prophetic ecstasies which shocked the more orderly
members of the church, and a separation ensued, in which Montanus was
joined by two prophetesses, Prisca and Maximilla; they continued for
some time, it would seem, to appeal to those within the greater church
to recognise them, for a fragment of Maximilla which is preserved to
us, runs thus:</p>

<p>"I am chased like a wolf from the flock; I am wolf, I am utterance,
spirit and power." (Eusebius v.§ 16). [p.  45]</p>

<p>Some, like Tertullian, listened; but the Church, as a whole, was
frightened at the excesses of their enthusiasm and probably, as a
result, prophecy became more than ever suspect. Irenaeus, it is true,
mentions amongst the Divine gifts still given to Christians in his
day, that some have the knowledge of things to come, as also visions
and prophetic communications (Eus. v. § 7), but this certainly does
not imply any frequent and general gift like that in the early church
of Corinth.</p>

<p>His contemporary Alcibiades, indeed, writes a book to demonstrate
the impropriety of a prophet's speaking in ecstasy, which Apollinaris
abridged (Eus. v. § 17). The good bishop of Hierapolis was very
earnest in his attack against the Montanists: "They will never be able
to show," he writes, "that any in the Old or New Testament were thus
violently agitated and carried away in spirit. Neither will they be
able to boast that Agabus or Judas or Silas or the daughters of
Phillip or Ammia, in Philadelphia, or Quadratus or others, that do not
belong to them, ever acted in this way." It is very significant that
the latest examples of eminent prophets in the Church here named, are
Quadratus and Ammia. Ammia appears to be unknown to Eusebius, who
alludes to her in this chapter as "one Ammia," but Quadratus he has
mentioned in a previous book as a prophet contemporary with Ignatius,
in these words: "Of those that flourished in these times Quadratus is
said to have been distinguished for his prophetical gifts. There
[p.46] were many others also noted in these times who held the first
rank in the apostolic succession." (iii.  § 37); whether this
Quadratus is to be identified with the philosopher who wrote an
apology for Christianity to Hadrian (iv.§ 3) is uncertain.</p>

<p>It seems from the words of Apollinaris, which Eusebius goes on to
quote (v. § 17), that the Montanists claimed that their prophets and
prophetesses were the successors of Ammia and Quadratus, but Maximilla
had now been dead for some years, and the bishop challenges his
opponents to point to any living prophet who had succeeded her: "And
if you have no succession of prophets then," he urges, "you must give
up your claim to represent the Christian Church. (For the apostle
shows that the gift of prophecy shall be in all the church until the
coming of the Lord)." What would have been the bishop's answer if the
Montanists had turned on him with the demand that he, too, should
produce his living prophets within the pale of the great church? In
view of what he has told us, may we not believe that his answer would
be somewhat on this wise: "The gift of prophecy has never been removed
from the church; though it may be dormant as far as such prophecies as
those of Quadratus are concerned, it may be called forth again at any
time by the Divine will, and will be recognised at once by the
bishops, who are the divinely appointed authorities, without whose
approval no true prophet will act. And if there be no such prophets
[p.47] now, in any church, the bishop takes their place, expounding as
is fit the will of the Lord to the people, and guided himself by the
Holy Spirit"? How are we to explain this remarkable change that we
have thus witnessed, and was it the necessary and right development of
the Church which led to it?</p>

<p>To those who know how, in the seventeenth century, another
experiment was begun, which after nearly nine generations, is not yet
ended, in the holding together of religious communities of which an
essential feature has always been the freedom of prophesying, it may,
at first sight, seem easy to reply that the change was no necessary
one.</p>

<p>One would not say that they were wrong, for who can say what might
not have been, if men had only been faithful to their highest ideals,
and been willing always to take the rough and narrow way that leads
straight up to the heavenly city? But we shall, perhaps judge more
fairly if we think how very much greater were the difficulties that
beset the Christian organisms of the first and second centuries, than
those, great as they were, with which George Fox had to grapple. He
had, it is true, to deal with companies of men and women, amongst whom
were enthusiasts or individualistic quietists, who would brook no
discipline, and many of them were poor and very ignorant folk; but how
different in many cases was a church of the first century. Imagine a
[p.48] community of varying nationalities, containing a number of
slaves, many of them illiterate people, others degraded by their past
life to the lowest depths; men and women rescued from lives of
terrible evil and still under constant temptation to fall back; a
number of Christian Jews with strange oriental customs and traditions,
half- familiar only with the language and civilisation of their
adopted town; a few men, possibly, of higher social position and
greater education, but the majority only able to communicate with each
other by a lingua franca of bad Greek, which was the native tongue
only of a small minority. One can see what a babel of confusion might
easily arise amongst such a community, especially when we remember
that many had but an imperfect knowledge of Christ and His teaching,
and very few churches possessed all the works which we have in our New
Testament.</p>

<p>Moreover, a great change had come from the days of Paul's letter to
the Corinthians. That little church was then still living in the days
when the Christians as such were tolerated by the law.  Gallio's
decision had removed the church at Corinth from any need to observe
secrecy.</p>

<p>But after two generations the position had wholly changed, and to
be a Christian was a penal offence which, if adhered to, was
punishable with death. This necessarily involved a need for greater
precaution, for more order and wise management in the assembling of
the Church. [p.49] And in the early days when the churches lived in
constant expectation of the immediate end of the age and the outward
coming of Christ to set up His Kingdom, they would naturally lay
little stress on church order; the struggle of the church militant was
but to last a brief time more; there was no need for much
organisation, or for any other connection between one church and
another than the friendly ties of love. One church might have its
prophets and teachers, another only presbyters or a bishop and
deacons; others of larger size and needs might have ail these officers
together with deaconesses and widows. But no one was anxious about
such differences. Travelling apostles and evangelists formed living
links of love betwixt church and church, and occasionally, individuals
and churches sent letters to each other.  No other bond was
needed.</p>

<p>But when it became slowly more evident that the Church might yet
have to continue long years at work in the world before the
consummation came, and when it seemed to the leaders that they had to
fight a life and death struggle, on the one hand against the vast
force of the world empire of Rome, whenever a persecuting edict might
be enforced, and on the other against a growing crowd of strange
errors, which seemed to them to be sent by the Devil to delude the
hearts of the faithful, and draw them away from the Gospel of Christ;
can we wonder that they did their best to draw the scattered
communities of [p.50] Christians to a sense of unity under a like
organization, adapted for a strenuous fight to preserve the good order
of the Church from being shattered by persecutions from without or
broken up and corrupted by false or mistaken brethren from within. And
often, too, especially under the fire of persecution, something of the
true prophetic spirit showed itself in the bishops themselves, as they
admonished their fellow believers to be faithful even unto death, and
beheld, amidst the shadow of death, visions of the deep things of
God. Very true is this of Ignatius, whose letters breathe forth again
and again the fiery faith and zeal of the true prophet, with flashes
now and then of great and Christlike thoughts that still shine like
gems amid the dust of pious exposition and mistaken exegesis that even
first century Christian literature shares as a characteristic with our
own. In the letter which he wrote to his friend Polycarp, bishop of
Smyrna, one sees how intensely he felt the importance of a bishop's
work for the life of the Church, how great the need was for gifted and
holy men to fill such posts and what true help such men were able to
give to the struggling communities for whom they lived and whom they
served. Ignatius, for all his exaltation of the bishop's office, is
full of humanity, feeling his own unworthiness and regarding himself
as the servant of his church. As we hear him urging upon Polycarp to
do his best to save all his flock, to put up with them all, even as
Christ bears with [p.51] him, to love not just the good disciples but
rather more especially the worse, and to conquer them by gentleness,
to stand like a rock against false teaching, to care for the widows
and not to overlook the slaves, we feel indeed how high the task of
such a bishop was; and with both Ignatius and Polycarp, as with
countless of their less illustrious fellows, it was a task crowned by
martyrdom.</p>

<p>But if history shows us how valuable was the work done under the
system of the catholic hierarchy to preserve a living Christianity
across the centuries, it also bears witness to the way in which in
succeeding ages the prophetic spirit re-asserted itself. A long series
of heresies from that of the Montanists in the second century to that
of the Fraticelli in the fourteenth, or of the Lollards and Hussites
in the fifteenth, up to the days of the Reformation and the Anabaptist
prophets of Munster, give us evidence of the way in which that spirit
meets the profound need of humanity and proves the outcome of deep
stirring of soul. But inside the Church itself we shall find again
that the spirit of prophecy cannot be banished, just because there
always was true life there. Yet the prophetic gift does not go along
the orthodox channels of the hierarchy, but is continually bursting
out in new and unexpected quarters, so that often the authorities of
the Church are in a strait whether they are dealing with a saint or a
heretic. To those outside the Church, the canon sometimes seems
strange enough which [p.52] rules into one class St. Theresa, into the
other Madame Guyon, which, after burning Savonarola was almost on the
point of canonising him, which deposed and exiled John of Parma, and
then beatified him. The prophetic spirit surely often found its outlet
in the early ages amongst the monks of the desert, witness for
instance such a saint as Telemachus, who brought to an end the
gladiatorial shows at Rome; and in later times first in the
Benedictine and the subsequent monastic orders, and then, very
notably, in the Franciscan brotherhood, it found freer outlets than
the church of the day could provide, while the lives of countless
saints bear witness to some touches at least of the spirit of the
prophet re-asserting itself in spite of the trammels of the
organization of the church. If the gift of prophecy were to be
connected with a divinely ordered hierarchy we might naturally look
for it most of all in the popes. Yet in so many centuries
comparatively few popes have been canonised as saints, and few amongst
these are conspicuous as showing forth this gift in the way in which
we see it in such a simple woman as Catherine of Siena, or in plain
men like Giles of Perugia.</p>

<p>In our own day, a devout catholic like Fogazzaro has pictured for
us the way in which a true prophet may arise within the bosom of the
Church, only to meet with obstacles from the authorities, and finally
with persecution ending almost in martyrdom. Yet that book, which, in
spite of [p.53] Papal prohibition, has found such warm support and
awakened such eager interest in Catholic Italy, bears witness to the
profound longing (which many in England surely share) that there is
within the orthodox Church for a deep spiritual ministry, which the
recognised authorities have not always supplied, for a revelation of
new truth to meet the needs of our day, for a fresh unfolding of the
meaning of the gospel of Christ, which shall appeal once more with
apostolic power to the hearts of men.</p>

<p>Two centuries ago the early Quakers felt that they had known such
an experience and tried to hand it on to others. Need we wonder if it
should appear that the Society of Friends to-day has inherited their
traditions but not their spirit? For, indeed, the prophetic spirit can
never be inherited, or passed on from man to man by any mechanical
arrangement. It must come anew from generation to generation, often
after the hardest travail of soul, through fresh strivings, as the
result of other needs; but we can, at least, see that our ordering,
whether of the Church's life or our own, is such as not to hinder its
coming but to prepare us for it.</p>

<p>And not the least of such a heritage has been a form of worship and
a view of life which may still give not only to a little community but
to a wider world a school of the prophets.</p>

<p>When we see the weak side of quietism, and mistakes of an earlier
day of mystics (as now we [p.54] are so apt to do), let us not forget
that, amidst the quietist Quakerism of the eighteenth century, there
grew up and flowered one of the most beautiful products not only of
Quaker but of Christian training; to many of us to-day, John Woolman
speaks as do few others with the power of a true prophet. Yet too
often in the past the Society of Friends has been content with a
succession of minor prophets, whose message was only to a little
congregation. Without was a multitude who had no priests or shepherds,
and nations needing a guide. To-day, if we cannot make teachers like
Woolman, at least we can prepare the way for their coming.</p>

<p>Prophecy is born of prayer, supported by it, not the prayer of
words, but that attitude of soul, of will, of which the most beautiful
of our collects are the momentary reflections. In this spirit then,
feeling our need and our fellows', let us long for more light to come
into our lives. Let us remember that we have not just to sit down
contentedly in the dark and wait for God's light.</p>

<p>If we try to listen to the voice of the prophet teachers of the
past whose message still comes home to us, and to picture the thoughts
of some disciple of theirs to-day, might we not frame them thus?</p>

<p>"If we cannot scatter the clouds, we can at least clean our windows
and open our doors. Every faculty of our nature is God's gift and to
be used in His service, and so we are not to think of prophecy [p.55]
as coming with the atrophy of the intellect; with every power of our
minds we are called to serve God and seek truth, which is His
revelation. To pray, ' Thy will be done ' should be, as Fogazzaro has
told us, no attitude of passive submission, but a call to our whole
nature to strive to the utmost for the cause of God.</p>

<p>"Then we must remember that the more truly we are at one with
Christ, the more we shall feel ourselves fundamentally united with all
our fellows. We shall feel their wrongs and sins as ours, and their
needs too, and as we come to feel this, we shall realise more and more
that in every act and word and thought we are not our own.</p>

<p>"Every evil desire overcome is a victory for our brothers, and not
merely for ourselves. Our lives are intertwined one with another, and
constantly, unseen and unknown to ourselves and each other, we
influence one another for evil or for good. The prophet is nothing
else than a true priest, not to one or two, but to a multitude.</p>

<p>"We are all called to be priests, and, if God calls us to be
prophets, in learning to be truly priests, we shall unconsciously be
learning too in the prophets' school.</p>

<p>"The priest must have a two-fold vision, of the truth above him and
of the brother beside him who has need of the truth. The more he can
see of either, the more he can be brought into communication with his
fellows, and with the truth, the more priestly will his service
be. [p.56] "Let us be faithful in word and deed to the highest that we
know, and higher things shall be revealed unto us.  Let us be patient
with the worst and those who naturally repel us.  Far more repulsive
has been the evil in our own thoughts in the eyes of the holy
angels. Let us not be uplifted because others have been helped through
us; Truth is not ours, but God's.</p>

<p>"Let us not be discouraged if our work seem fruitless; never
despair of the truth. Have faith in the truth that has been revealed
to you, for some day others too shall see it.</p>

<p>"Have faith in the Truth that is yet unknown; others perhaps have
already caught some glimpse of it.</p>

<p>"Blessed is the man in whose heart there is built an altar with the
inscription written: ' To the unknown Truth '; of such men are
prophets made.</p>

<p>"Truth is beautiful in the mouth of a friend, but most divine when
it is seen in the heart of an opponent. The devil had delight to seek
for faults in Job; let us seek rather to see, with Christ, the good in
the heart of the publican."</p>

<p>Those of us who are striving after this ideal should be the
greatest of sacerdotalists; our faith and worship are built up upon
belief in the essential priesthood of every human soul. Let us not
forget then, that if all men have some vision of God, all may teach us
something of Him. And since heavenly truth comes to no man naked, but
clad in changing robes, let us strive in our [p.57] search for truth,
alike in speaking and in listening, to remember that the garment of
words changes and may mean one thing to us and another to our
fellows. Let us get beneath words and forms to the life-giving spirit,
and as we are to be the greatest sacerdotalists let us be the most
thorough- going of ritualists too, to whom there are symbols and
lessons of the Divine Life, not only in the beautiful liturgies of the
altar, but in all the mysteries of nature and the sacraments with
which life is full.</p>

<p>For surely there are not merely two or seven sacraments, but
seventy times seven, for him whose heart seeks ever fellowship with
his brothers and with the Father above him, who would be loved in
them, and served by their service. The whole world is God's and full
of His light; our lives are His and they are our fellows. And since in
every heart of man is some well through which the God-given waters of
life may flow, we may go forth in faith to our work; as we serve our
neighbours and search for truth, in the spirit of followers of Christ
Jesus, seeking that our own wells may be made wider and deeper, and
that their springs may be shared more fully by others, God will make
priests of all of us, and, if He will it, prophets too. [p.58]</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_IV._SACRAMENTS"></a> CHAPTER IV. SACRAMENTS OF
LIFE.</h2>
<p>"THE Finger of God," wrote once Sir Thomas Browne, "hath left an
inscription upon all His works." We have little skill to read that
wondrous message, but from the very dawn of humanity men have tried to
trace the writing, have sought to spell out the words, and as they
came to perceive something of those spiritual forces that are at work
in the world, and to look beneath the surface of things to that which
lies deeper, they too have endeavoured to embody in outward forms for
themselves and for others the truths which they would apprehend.</p>

<p>The course of the ages changes the meaning of even the simplest
words which we use, for words, like men, are mortal; and so it has
come about that the thought which rises in our minds as we speak of a
sacrament is not that which came to those who used the word long
ago.</p>

<p>In the ancient days a sacrament was simply a holy thing, something
consecrated and set apart; in very early times it was especially a
sort of judicial pledge deposited by the parties in a law [p.59] suit;
then it came to mean the solemn oath of a soldier, pledging his
loyalty to his commander on entering upon his military service. It was
used by early Christian Latin writers to render the thought of the
Greek mystery,
<em>μυστήριον</em>, a word which we have failed to translate into
English, as so often we must fail in any translation from one tongue
to another to render thought for thought.</p>

<p>We think nowadays of a mystery as being something hidden, but to
the Greek it was rather a revelation; an unfolding through symbol of
that which could not be wholly expressed in any words. The mystery
remained a secret to him who was without, to the uninitiate; but the
initiate understood its meaning.</p>

<p>In the most famous mysteries of Greece, those which were celebrated
at Eleusis, it would seem that along with the idea of revelation of
truth went also the sense of upbuilding of the inward life, the
purification of the soul and the assimilation of the Divine things
imparted beneath the symbol. For revelation, the unveiling of truth,
is no one-sided act; it involves response in the mind that receives;
if the truth is apprehended, it must in part at least, be also
assimilated. And so every mystery is something more than the unfolding
of a hidden reality; it also implies the imparting of new
life.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> [p.60 ]</p>

<p>In the earlier Christian literature sacraments still bear this wide
meaning. Tertullian often uses the word thus. In one passage he speaks
of a woman known to him who was accustomed to go into ecstasies during
the weekly service of the Church; "she converses with angels,
sometimes even with the Lord, and both sees and hears
sacraments" <a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a> He
speaks of "the sacrament of allegory,"<a href="#_edn9" name=
"_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> "sacraments of metaphors," <a href=
"#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> in both cases alluding to
Old Testament types, and again, he explains the wood by which Moses
made the waters of Mara sweet (Exodus xv.), as a sacrament symbolizing
the cross <a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title= "">[11]</a></p>

<p>According to Prudentius, the early Christian poet, the Evangelist
tells us that Christ gave these [p.61] commands to His disciples:
"Seek not carefully for words when ye shall have to descant of my
sacrament," <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title= "">[12]</a> "my
Sacrament," being evidently here equivalent to "the Gospel."</p>

<p>But, as time passed by, the word sacrament became more and more
used for certain mysteries of the Church alone, although far down into
the middle ages even in this sense the word had a wider use than that
of the seven sacraments of the Council of Trent.</p>

<p>Thus in 393 A.D. the synod of Hippo made a decree as to the use of
the sacrament of salt at Easter by the catechumens, and in later times
the ringing of bells and the use of the sign of the cross were
regarded as sacraments. By the time of Augustine, however, the word
sacrament was frequently used in its narrower signification, and
already emphasis is laid on the saving power of the sacrament rather
than on its significance as a revelation. Yet Augustine, though
holding that the sacrament of baptism was necessary to salvation, once
wrote thus: "For what else are each of the bodily sacraments, but, so
to speak, certain visible words; most holy words it is true, but yet
mutable and temporal ones?" <a href= "#_edn13" name="_ednref13"
title="">[13]</a></p>

<p>It is this wider sense of the word which we must [p.62 ]be careful
not to lose, the use in which a sacrament means the unfolding and
imparting of the spiritual and eternal through that which we see and
hear and feel.</p>

<p>Because in times past the Church has tended to narrow the use of
the word, and, by confining the Divine operations to certain channels,
to misread the great sacrament of life, so lessening the mystery of
the world, there is all the more reason that we should not rest
content with seeing how inadequate such views have proved.  It is true
that over the doctrine of sacraments men have fought and wrangled,
forgetting the name by which they were called. But it is true, too,
that to countless souls it has seemed that through the sacraments the
Church has offered them help which has come as in no other way to
their lives. And surely this has not been all delusion. The error of
the sacramentalist in the past has often rather been that he has
confined the Divine presence and the Divine working to certain fixed
channels and unchanging visible signs.  Those of us who hold that
these good men have narrowed down the freedom of the inner life need
to meet them not by denying the Divine presence where they see it, but
by trying to see and to realize that presence ourselves more fully
throughout all our lives. We are called to the worship and the
knowledge of the transcendent and immanent God, who is here in the
midst of our lives, in the midst of His world and His works, yet is
far more than all these. [p.63] When the stern old Tertullian looked
out upon the pagan world around him and noted in its religious rites
strange mimicry and rivalry of the Christian mysteries, he could
perceive no good in what he saw. In the worship of Mithras he found a
baptism for the remission of sins, and a sign made on the forehead of
the soldier in this pagan army of salvation; a crown purchased by the
sword, and the ritual offering of bread. But all this, like the
ancient Roman rites of Numa, or the mysteries of Eleusis and of
Samothrace, seemed to him but the work of the Evil One. It was the
devil's part, he wrote, to invert the truth and make of it his own
counterparts, as he seemed to do in much of the ritual of the heathen
temple.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a></p>

<p>In like manner, in more modern times the early missionaries in the
far east learned with amazement of the way in which, in the mountains
of Thibet, the devil had made his imitation of the ceremonies and
offices of the Catholic Church, and wondered as they heard of the
Buddhist monasteries with their abbots and hierarchy of clergy, and
the celebration there of mysterious offices strangely resembling their
own mass, to the sound of bells and amid the smoke of incense.</p>

<p>In our own day an even wider area opens before [p.64 ]the
historian's vision, and across five continents men trace, under
various forms, rites whose origin seems the same. It is not now the
devil who is credited with inspiring these myriad devices, but perhaps
not a few of the students who return with Dr. Frazer from the survey
of this vast field are inclined to feel that they have reduced all
alike to one origin, in primitive savage superstition at work in the
presence of life, birth and death. But if Tertullian and his school
lack charity in their judgment on the sacraments of the heathen, there
is surely danger too that our modern men of science may lead us to
believe that in tracing a custom to its primitive origin they have
found its cause or explained its nature.  We can under- stand a thing
best, not merely by knowing its beginning, but by also viewing it in
its full development, judged not only by what it is at its lowest, or
when it is most degraded, but at its highest and best.</p>

<p>The world-wide use points surely to a world-wide need, expressing
itself in different ways, but in essentials the same.  Unconsciously,
indeed, in all our lives we make use of sacraments whenever we
apprehend the invisible and the higher through the medium of the
visible and lower. And, in our very thoughts, metaphors and symbols
are nothing else than sacraments expressing truth in pictorial
form. Even when men deliberately attempt to explain all life on a
basis of atheistic materialism they still feel the need of what might
[p.65] truly be called a kind of sacrament. It is very significant
from this point of view to find that some French secularists have
found it desirable to publish a ritual of civil
ceremonies, <a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a> in
which model liturgies are provided for a secular baptism, a secular
confirmation service, as well as secular marriage and burial
services. A conscious recognition of this same need led Auguste Comte
and his Positivist followers to devise an elaborate ritual which might
make their worship of Humanity more real.</p>

<p>The Society of Friends itself, which is popularly supposed to
represent a protest against all forms of sacraments, can illustrate in
its history the value of the true sacrament, and the danger there is
of doing worship to the form of the sacrament, rather than to the life
which makes it of worth.</p>

<p>No other Christian community has proved so strikingly the value in
worship of the beautiful sacrament of silence, that universal liturgy
in which all nations can unite; where ignorant and learned men come
together on a like basis. Yet the very fact that in speaking of this
we need to emphasize the worth of "Living silence," shows that too
often, even here, men have but honoured a dead silence, making an idol
of the sacrament which was only a means to an end, not an end in
itself.</p>

<p>We may see even more clearly how easy it is for the form to become
a bondage in the history of [p.66] another strange Quaker sacrament,
that of the "Plain dress" of the middle nineteenth century. There is
no need to tell how, in the case of this custom, the protest against
changing fashions became itself the most tyrannous of fashions. What
is especially interesting to us now, is to note that the dress which
was an outward sign of inward grace became to be considered as, in a
sense, holy itself. A young man or woman would wear the ordinary dress
of the day, and suddenly some time of decision would come, a crisis in
the inner life, and perfectly naturally the change would be marked by
the adoption in the plain dress of the older generation. And it even
became customary to associate the length of the hat brim with the
holiness of the wearer's life; the truer to Quaker principles he was,
the longer was the brim. It has been said that you may find in a
journal written seventy years ago such an entry as this: "I think I
can honestly, yet in all humility, say that in the past year there has
been a growth in grace, and I have ventured to add a quarter of an
inch to the brim of my hat." We smile; yet for some of us at least
that ancient costume is so redolent of beautiful memories that we can
scarce bear to laugh at its vagaries; we know too well the sacramental
efficacy of the old Friend's bonnet, which forever recalls the
goodness and love of the face beneath it.</p>

<p>It is strange that in the ancient Church of Rome men should have
come to think in much the same [p.67] way of the peculiar habits of
the religious orders, regarding the monk's dress itself as something
sacred, which an unworthy man dishonoured, and which actually helped
its wearer to be holier in his life just as the old Quaker dress was
felt by many to help them to be more consistent in all their ways with
the ideal which they strove to realize. So strong was this feeling
that men who were not members of an Order sometimes obtained as a
privilege to wear for a time the cord, to die in the habit, or even to
be buried in it, the dress itself being felt to be sacramental.</p>

<p>If these minor sacraments came to be so misunderstood, how natural
it is that similar misunderstandings should arise as to sacraments in
common use throughout the whole Church, and associated with the very
deepest truths of the inner life. Yet if we go back to their origin we
shall see that the two chief sacraments of the Church were most simple
acts expressing in visible language the life of the spirit, acts
perfectly natural and full of significance to those who first took
part in them, but which in later days have too often lost their
meaning because the mere form was held to have some magical efficacy
in itself.</p>

<p>To understand these sacraments aright do we not need to enter into
the spirit of the Teacher in whose name they are celebrated, and who
is believed to have instituted them? As we read the evangelists'
record of the life and words of Jesus, [p.68] we must surely feel that
to him all life was a sacrament, a continual unfolding of the Divine
through the visible world and through human life. In his eyes the
sunshine falling alike upon good and evil men is a constant revelation
of the Divine love, compassing just and unjust, overcoming evil with
good. The beautiful flowers of the field, blooming for a moment and
then destroyed, bring to him no thoughts of gloom, as they did to the
Greek poet, but the certainty that the Power which gives such
loveliness to the creatures of an hour will provide for His higher
creation too. The sparrows chirruping under the eaves, humblest of
birds, fill him with a sense of the Father's care for these, and much
more for man. As Christ walks across the fields, he sees messages for
men in all the life about him: the parable of the seed, summing up the
whole mystery of our nature in its life and growth; the sower at his
work, the fishermen at their task, all are parables for him. And so it
is with the relationships of our human life, which Christ takes up in
his teaching and makes sacramental. Because he is in unbroken
communion with the Father unseen, he constantly brings all the little
things of daily life into relationship with Him.</p>

<p>Christ found the religious folk of his day intent on fulfilling
certain duties; eager to guard the letter of the scriptures, the
sacredness of the sabbath, and to fulfil the various acts which the
law prescribed. He did not destroy the sacredness of [p.69] the one
day by his treatment of the sabbath, but he raised the other days to
its level: he did not secularize life by his attitude to the law, but
rather recognised all life as holy. Religion was no longer to be
something confined to certain acts and to special offices and places,
but rather the attitude of the soul toward God and one's fellows, a
spirit pervading the whole life and not concerned merely with the
externals of duty or with certain special seasons of prayer.</p>

<p>Was it not natural, and even necessary, that One who looked thus
upon the world, seeing every- thing in relation to God as the Author
and the end of life, should make of the commonest acts a means to the
Source of all strength? The water of purification, without which men
could not live a clean and healthy life, the daily bread without which
they could not live at all, the wine which stood for the inspiring
fellowship which makes life worth living, were symbols ready to hand
and full of spiritual meaning.</p>

<p>We have a perfect instance, in the account given in the fourth
Gospel of the washing of the disciples' feet, of the true nature of
the sacrament, and we are able perhaps to see it more clearly because
the actual form of this sacrament has never been in general use in the
Church, and men have almost ceased to think of it as a sacrament at
all. "Except I wash thee thou hast no part in me," the Master says to
Peter; so necessary was the sacrament. Yet the mere form meant
nothing, when the thought [p.70] and life beneath it was not entered
into, for Judas too, submitted to the ordinance, and went out to
betray his Lord. We are told how, when Christ had ended this visible
parable, the disciples were bidden even so to wash each other's
feet. Often possibly in after years one or another may have done a
like act for his friend, and recalled the Master's words in doing
it. But this sacrament never became fixed into a form, and so even now
we can clearly see its meaning. Indeed, had it become a custom of the
Church, Christians would have needed to have been very simple and
humble if the ordinance were not to lose its significance. In the few
instances where the rite of feet-washing is still observed, we see how
far removed to-day the ceremony may be from the thought which once
inspired it. The selected poor, who have first been carefully washed
before the ceremony, are marshalled in stately order, attendant
dignitaries are ready at hand with ewers of scented water and basins
of precious metal; and so, yearly, do Pope and Emperor commemorate the
scene in the upper chamber where in very different wise one whose
kingdom was not of this world taught his followers the way they should
serve him by serving one another.</p>

<p>The sacrament of baptism would seem to be one which comes naturally
to the Eastern peoples: it has been in use for ages among the Hindus
of India, and it was apparently in general vogue in Palestine in
Christ's time. It would appear [p.71] to have been not so familiar to
the Western world, for the evangelist Mark has to explain to his
Gentile reader how it was the custom of the Pharisees to baptize pots
and vessels, and even beds. Apparently, even in that day the symbol of
purification had come to have a magical significance. The washing or
purification as a symbol of initiation is common to many religions,
and it was a natural pictorial language for the prophet John the
Baptist to employ, to express the change of life that was to follow
the repentance which he preached. Christ's disciples had, many of
them, first been followers of John, and would readily continue to use
this sign in their ministry. But though Baptism was to the early
Church the natural expression of entrance into the new life of
Christianity (as we see in the case of Philip and the Ethiopian
eunuch), yet it is hard to imagine that if it were held to possess in
itself the importance which in later time was attached to it, the
Apostle Paul would actually rejoice in the fact that he had hardly
baptized any converts at all himself. <a href="#_edn16"
name="_ednref16" title= "">[16]</a> Already, however, the ceremony had
a meaning deeper than the simple act of purification severing the old
life from the new, which was probably that of the first baptisms of
the disciples during the lifetime of Christ. We gather from Paul's
words that in baptism the believer made real to himself, and to those
about him, his [p.72] going down with Christ into the waters of death
and his rising again with him into a new life, by the power of the
resurrection. Some inherent virtue was soon thought to attach to the
outward act itself, or else one can scarcely explain the origin of
that strange custom of baptism for the dead, alluded to in the same
epistle. <a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title= "">[17]</a></p>

<p>This thought of the inherent worth of baptism continued to grow
until by the beginning of the fifth century it became generally held
that without it salvation was impossible. The Christian con- science,
however, discovered a way to remove what would have been the hardest
application of such a belief by what was spoken of as the baptism of
blood. If an unbaptized convert was martyred for the name of Christ
(as often might happen), the martyr's death was held to be itself a
baptism, and this idea was extended to what was called the baptism of
desire, or the baptism of faith, whenever death occurred before it was
possible for a convert to be baptized.  The classical instance of
this, discussed by St. Augustine and frequently cited by subsequent
writers, is that of the penitent thief upon the
cross, <a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title= "">[18]</a> And
Tertullian, who called baptism the "seal of faith," goes so far as to
say "we do not receive the washing of purification [p.73] in order to
cease from sinning, since we had already been washed in our
hearts." <a href="#_edn19" name= "_ednref19" title="">[19]</a> The
seal of baptism was in his view the legal and visible completion of
the act, not the act itself.  Still, he holds baptism to be the
needful "vesture of faith," as he calls it in another passage, and
accordingly discusses the difficulty raised by some heretics of his
own time, that Paul being the only baptized apostle, the other
apostles could none of them be saved; though he does not feel it
needful to adopt the explanation of certain orthodox ritualists of his
day, who held, he tells us, that the apostles were possibly baptized
on the occasion when the waves beat in upon them in the little ship on
the sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>It was not to be wondered at that, with such a view of baptism
current in the Church, the Catholic missionaries of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries should have laid stress rather on the numbers
whom they could baptize than any other result. It is indeed at once
pathetic and amusing to turn over the leaves of the letters from the
missions which the good Jesuit fathers wrote two centuries and more
ago, describing the progress of their work among the American
Indians. You may read there the words of a missionary spending
laborious days amid all manner of hardships, baptizing the sick and
aged when very near to death and therefore removed from the danger of
possible relapse into infidelity, and especially [p.74] rejoicing in
the number of souls won by the baptism of dying infants, who could not
possibly fall away from grace.</p>

<p>To such almost ludicrous notions do men come through materialising
the pictorial language of the primitive sacrament, and imagining that
its visible words have magical efficacy in themselves. Yet the thought
of the scene in the upper room on the night of the last supper makes
us feel how much that visible language might mean in its first
simplicity.</p>

<p>As simple and as natural was that other sacrament, when Christ took
the bread from the supper table, and the cup of fellowship, and gave
them to those friends of his as his body and very life, which he was
giving for them and for their fellows. What could be more fitting than
that they should henceforth remember this farewell supper, this
supreme gift of himself, when their master was taken from their sight,
whenever they partook again of the Passover, nay, whenever they met
together as disciples to share in a common meal in the name of him
they loved? The more fully they lived in his spirit the more simply
would each meal they took with one another be hallowed by the thought
of his love and his presence.</p>

<p>Thus did the disciples in the early days take together the
Eucharist meal from house to house in Jerusalem: and so, in the midst
of the storm, Paul took it, before wondering fellow-passengers and
crew, mingling the prayer of joyful thanks-[p.75]giving with the
remembrance of the Lord for whose name he was suffering hardship.</p>

<p>Already in the time of Paul the communion service was beginning to
lose its first simple spontaneity, as we may note in his directions to
the Church at Corinth, but for long afterwards the Eucharist was in a
much wider sense sacramental, than when its meaning was defined and
imprisoned in the formulae of theologians.  How full of beauty must
the eucharist have been in those little churches of Asia
Minor, <a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title= "">[20]</a> for which
perhaps the Didache, "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," was
written, towards the beginning of the second century. The eucharist
prayer of the Didache is a true prayer of thanks: "We thank Thee, our
Father, for the life and knowledge which Thou didst make known to us
through Thy servant Jesus; Unto Thee the glory evermore !" "For as
this broken piece of bread was scattered over the mountains and
brought together and became one, so may Thy church be brought together
from the ends of the earth into Thy Kingdom, for Thine is the glory
and the power through Christ Jesus evermore."</p>

<p>Thus was the eucharist meal to early Christians a symbol of the
unity of the Church, and a means of drawing them nearer in thought to
each other. [p.76]</p>

<p>It is sad to think that what in those days was a bond of union
should have become in later times a source of bitter contention and
misunderstanding; may we not resolve that for our part, however we may
differ from each other, or from the majority of Christians, in our
views about this observance, we will not let this hinder us from
realizing that others may be helped by means which do not aid us, and
that it is infinitely better to draw near to God through outward forms
than to be without them and not to draw near to Him: that what we need
is to realize and to claim the liberty by which a hundred forms may
become sacramental, and not to deny the reality of the life which may
underlie the fixed forms which others use.</p>

<p>Luther once said that God might have made a sacrament of a bit of
stick, had He chosen; Pusey repeated the saying to a friend with a
shudder, telling him that it showed an irreverent mind. <a href=
"#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> Yet surely Luther's words
convey the very key to our comprehending the truth of the Real
Presence, which may be revealed without outward form, or under
innumerable forms, just because God is so much nearer than we think,
ever at work in His world, still disclosing Himself to those who seek
with humble heart, even though they call Him not by His name. What we
need above all is the spirit which will fill our lives with such
sacraments, revelations of God to us and to our fellows. Sometimes we
may be helped by an [p.77] ancient usage of the Church, at others by
some new symbol: what matter the shape of the chalice if the wine be
there?</p>

<p>John Henry Newman, in his early Protestant days, was wont to make
use of the sign of the cross and to find it helpful. It is a sacrament
which loses its meaning the moment one thinks of it as having any
magical effect in itself, but if it be used to remind oneself of that
which it stands for, as the symbol of the perfect deed of
self-sacrifice, it may well help many learners in the school of
Christ.</p>

<p>In like manner to-day, the wearing of a badge of membership in some
society, or adult school (as twenty years ago a piece of blue ribbon),
may doubtless prove an effectual sacrament to many men, aiding them to
be faithful to a resolution made, as well as showing forth their
belief to others. The sign is in itself useless, yet may mean much to
the men who make it their symbol of comradeship.</p>

<p>The more worth living our lives prove, the fuller they will be of
true sacraments, in little things and in great. The immense sacrament
of nature is ever about us, and our human intercourse is made up, in
all that makes it of worth, of count- less lesser sacraments. What
meaning there may be in a simple handshake, and how much help and
strength it may pass on to another! The mere physical act is as
nothing in itself, yet it may avail to alter a whole
life. Nevertheless, [p.78] we must see even here how easily mere
custom may diminish or destroy the use of such a thing. In the studied
greeting of formal civility the sacramental character disappears. Or
worse still, that which was intended to be a medium of friendship
becomes a means of undoing friendship's work. For so long as wrong
exists in our lives we must beware of the sacraments of evil by which
the ties which bind us to each other and to the world about us become
the Devil's bonds instead of God's leading-strings.</p>

<p>The act, or the thing which forms the sacrament, may be in itself
used either for good or ill. To one man even it may be good, while to
another it may be a means of harm. The greater need, therefore, have
we neither to judge our neighbour, nor ourselves to do lightly things
which may be a means of good for him, but for us a sacrament of
ill.</p>

<p>To take a single instance: Wandering in his father's library, a boy
comes upon a book which he begins to read; and suddenly the conviction
comes to him that he ought not to go on. The book is full of interest;
perhaps in later years he may return to it and find its thoughts most
helpful. And yet it may be that this book, which at a later time might
prove a sacrament of good, may be for him now nothing but a sacrament
of evil, since his mind is not ready to understand its teaching.</p>

<p>In the world without us there are some things so constantly
associated with thoughts of goodness [p.79] and beauty that they seem
almost naturally God's sacraments. Such are the flowers, which
constantly call to our minds thoughts of joy and kindness; the
sunlight, which cheers and invigorates; and drives away the disease
that is the symbol of wrongdoing; the light, whose essence is so pure
that it has become an image of the Divine nature. These are among
nature's sacraments, and in the life of man we have, above all, the
sacrament of the family, which at its best is an image of the love of
the All-highest, and a foretaste of His Kingdom among men, of the city
which is to be, in which all are members of one another, living to
serve each other.</p>

<p>It may comfort us to think that the devil's sacraments are not so
all-pervading; for night, which we think of as the cloak of evil, may
itself be to the devout soul a symbol of the mysterious peace of
God. One thinks of those wonderful lines of Vaughan:</p>

<p><em>Dear Night! the world's defeat;</em></p>

<p><em>The stop to busy fools; care's check and curb;</em></p>

<p><em>The day of spirits; my soul's calm retreat</em></p>

<p><em>Which none disturb!</em></p>

<p><em>Christ's progress, and His prayer-time;</em></p>

<p><em>The hours to which high Heaven doth climb.</em></p>

<p><em>God's silent, searching flight;</em></p>

<p><em>When my Lord's head is fill'd with dew, and all</em></p>

<p><em>His locks are wet with the clear drops of night;</em></p>

<p><em>His still, soft call;</em></p>

<p><em>His knocking time; the soul's dumb watch,</em></p>

<p><em>When spirits their fair kindred catch. [p.80]</em></p>

<p><em>Were all my loud, evil days</em></p>

<p><em>Calm and unhaunted, as is thy dark tent,</em></p>

<p><em>Whose peace but by some angel's wing or voice</em></p>

<p><em>Is seldom rent;</em></p>

<p><em>Then I in Heaven all the long year</em></p>

<p><em>Would keep, and never wander here.</em></p>

<p><em>* * * *</em></p>

<p><em>There is in God &mdash; some say &mdash;</em></p>

<p><em>A deep, but dazzling darkness; as men here</em></p>

<p><em>Say it is late and dusky, because they</em></p>

<p><em>See not all clear.</em></p>

<p><em>O for that Night ! Where I in Him</em></p>

<p><em>Might live invisible and dim!</em></p>

<p>or we may remember the "Hymns to Night" of Novalis, and that
experience known to so many saints, which St. John of the Cross speaks
of as "the obscure night of the soul," the darkness which we needs
must traverse before we come to know the greater light beyond. The
stern angel of pain seems to many a fiend; but some have found him to
be a friend at the last, and certainly there is something in the heart
of sorrow that no other experience brings to us, unless it be great
joy, and as we feel it, we seem to understand that the spirit of joy
and the spirit of sorrow are angels near akin.</p>

<p>In the world that man has made there is one thing above all others
through which the influences of evil seem to work, the devil's
sacrament of money. When one thinks of the hatreds and lusts springing
to birth around it, and the curse it so often seems to bring alike to
"him that gives and him that takes," when one sees wealth, [p.81]
remorseless in its pride of power, worshipped and cringed to by its
recipients and its courtiers, it is easy to understand how a simple
Christlike man like St. Francis would have no dealings with money, and
shunned to touch it as we might some plague-infected garment. And yet
how often has this hateful thing been redeemed from its base use to be
the minister of right. Even money is not hopelessly lost for good. The
sacramental efficacy of the widow's mite has not ceased through all
the centuries since she cast it, in her humility, into God's
treasury. The sand hides the gold of Pharaoh, and the imperial
treasures of Augustus are vanished and forgotten, but that poor
woman's gift still goes on: she gave to God, to the best and highest
that she knew, and in giving, little thought that through the word of
the Master of Masters, her tiny coin could become for ever a sacrament
to humanity.</p>

<p>So may a little thing and a base thing be made a symbol of good;
most of all then should we find a channel of revelation in the highest
thing we know; not only in the sacrament of nature, but in the
sacrament of man.</p>

<p>Surely to us the most wonderful thing in life is personality, and
it is human personality which may be the highest sacrament of good, or
the most terrible sacrament of ill. Our deeds are often at their best
poor clumsy acts that stray in the dark; our thoughts are all
imperfect, and our words fail to express them fully. But in spite of
all [p.82] this failure, soul acts upon soul, we know not how, and the
influence of one life upon another goes out continually like the
myriad rays of a lamp. Silently men are changed and transformed by
this influence. And there is no man but is doing his part for good or
ill in this transforming work, whatever he may be, wherever he may
go. Is it not thus that God's self-revelation in Christ becomes real
to the Christian? God speaks to us in Jesus through human
personality. We draw near to him as a man, we see his life and listen
to his words, and as we gaze and listen, we feel that God has taken
hold of us.</p>

<p>We are very near now to the greatest of sacraments. Did not the
apostle speak of the union of the Church with Christ as μέγα
μυστήριου,
<em>magnum sacramentum</em>? The follower must bear, in some measure,
in his life, the likeness of his master; the nearer we draw to him,
the more his presence will mould our lives with the impress of his
character.</p>

<p>In the ideal marriage, even as we know it realised sometimes now,
husband and wife live in such close communion, so share their
thoughts, and feelings, so enter into each other's lives, that each
character, reacting on the other, grows ever more like to it. May not
this thought help us to understand something of what is meant by
Christ's union with his Church? The Church is humanity in its ideal
form, humanity as a whole striving after its true goal, and the human
race comes to [p.83] understand and realize its aim by union with
Christ, thus gradually growing to be more like him and to share his
nature. The end and the means to it are no mere rapture of holy
emotion, no selfish joy of idle contemplation. The relation- ship is
much deeper; it must affect our whole character.  It is not a rush of
sentiment but a union of will.</p>

<p>After years of discipleship, and when he had gone through many
things that he might draw nearer to the spirit of Christ, there came
to St. Francis that wonderful crowning vision of the Saviour
crucified, and amidst the joy of the vision there was pain. From that
hour to the day of his death, the record tells us, did Francis bear in
secret upon his body the marks of the passion. It does not matter how
his frail frame came to respond to the thoughts that so dominated his
mind: the important thing for us is not the accidental consequence to
the body, but the attitude of mind and spirit, the union of will with
a Christ suffering for humanity, bearing the sins of the world. He who
has come to be made thus, in the humblest way, the comrade of Christ,
must be the comrade too of all his fellow-men. Church and individual
alike must show in character and life the meaning of this fellowship
&mdash; fellowship in joy and in sorrow, too, willingness to learn, to
give and to serve. Sharing the burdens of rich and poor, feeling the
bonds that bind their lives, accepting ourselves responsibility and
blame [p.84] for all ignorance and failure and wrongdoing, we may
realize that the spirit of Christ is still at work in the world, that
closer than our thoughts is the infinite love, and beneath our
weakness the infinite strength of the Father's arms.</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_V:_SOME"></a> CHAPTER V: SOME OF NATURE'S
SACRAMENTS</h2>
<p>THE life of words is like in some ways to the life of men; the soul
changes within them, though the form remains the same. Yet while
language is still living it may regain something of its old power
beneath the poet's healing fingers, and now and again a master of
words will recall for us some dying form of speech. A writer of power
is needed, surely to win us back the older and wiser use of the word
sacrament as a spiritual symbol, the revelation of the unseen through
the visible, the unfolding of the unknown through the known. "The
image of the world," wrote Bacon,
<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> "is a message of
the Divine wisdom and power"; to many a mystic it has been more even
than this, and nature has been full of sacraments bringing life from
things not seen.</p>

<p>The story is told of the old Calabrian Abbot, Joachim da Fiore,
that as he was saying vespers in some little church among the
mountains, the glory of the setting sun caught his eye through the
open [p.86 ] door of the nave. Suddenly realizing how much more
beautiful was the great temple of the sunlit sky than the painted
stone walls of his little building made with hands, he led his
congregation out into the open air, and with nature's ritual around
them they went on praying, gazing upon the picture of that evening
landscape and the wonder of the sunset above. Though he was the
adopted father of many admirable heretics, and for long a suspect
himself, Blessed Joachim did not offend thus more than once, as far as
we know, against the laws of ritual. But many another saint must have
been tempted to do as he did. It is, indeed, easy for us to understand
how in the old days every high place had its altar, and how again and
again in later times solitude upon a mountain has seemed to give the
most congenial atmosphere for prayer.  Unconsciously, and quite apart
from our beliefs, we instinctively turn in physical weariness, and
often in other troubles, to the calm rest of nature. However much at
times we may ponder her sterner side, and search in vain to explain to
ourselves the mysteries of death and pain with which she confronts us
constantly, it is not these things of which she speaks to man, when he
goes to her sad and weary, like a tired child to his nurse. A feeling
of quietness, beneath which lies strength, the dim apprehension of
law, inexplicable indeed, but majestic and even beautiful, and above
all that indefinable sense of peace which comes to us sometimes when
we [p.87] are in the presence of that which is immeasurably greater
than ourselves, all this may nature bring to us, when we go to her
alone with our troubles. The old stoics must have sometimes felt this,
though to the Roman mind at least wild nature did not usually possess
the attractive power it has for us.  One cannot but feel that when
Marcus Aurelius cries to the Universe "that which is harmonious to
thee, is to me too," he is conscious of something of this feeling in
which our petty cares and troubles sink into nothingness amid the
waters of the great ocean of universal life; though he arrived at the
sense of this rather by inward meditation than by the contemplation of
nature without him.  And whatever the philosophers may have felt, one
has no doubt of the poets. Propertius, alone in the Umbrian highlands
by the sources of the Tiber, and Catullus, listening to the ripple of
the waves of Garda, were able for a moment to rise above the pain and
fire of passion into a calmer air; and yet the Roman poets have no
such sense of the overwhelming majesty and order of nature as came to
the Hebrew Psalmists.</p>

<p>The Roman had still in dim recesses of his consciousness the
feelings of an earlier age, for which every wild wood was peopled with
mysterious powers; nature was full of unknown agencies whose workings
man could but dimly perceive, and the ancient rites of his religion
were the charms by which he held at bay the strange potencies of evil
that surrounded him. The [p.88] Hebrew poet looked on nature even in
her sterner aspects with the eyes of faith; hailstorm and thunder, and
the very sea his people thought of with such dread, brought
revelations to him of the Divine power controlling all; and because of
this sense of unity, the mystery and wonder of the starry sky seemed
to his inward ear vocal with harmonies. In some ways there has come to
us in the last two centuries fuller knowledge of that reign of law
which formed a part of the religious consciousness of the poets of
ancient Israel.  Science speaks to us of the insignificance of man
beside the illimitable greatness of the universe of which he is ever
striving to gain some knowledge, and trains us to revere the majesty
of laws which he can only imperfectly apprehend. Yet it is well known
how sadly one great leader of modern science regretted that in his old
age he was no longer able to know the feeling of the beauty and
majesty of the Alpine landscape which had so often helped him in the
past, because, as it seemed to him, the habit of scientific analysis
had taken from him that simpler sense of the earlier years, the direct
consciousness of a beauty he could not explain.  So true it is that
the child's eyes and the childlike spirit only find the entrance into
the Kingdom of Heaven, which is hid to the wise. One must not suppose,
indeed, that the closing of this one door into the unseen means that
others, too, are shut, or else the lot of the city-dweller would be
even worse than it is. Dr.  Johnson, kindliest and best [p.89] of
townsmen, though he said that to see one green field was to see all
green fields, was yet keenly sensitive to many of the lesser
sacraments of man's social life; and those who read his prayers and
meditations know that the invisible realities were to him no mere
object of intellectual belief, but the atmosphere of his inmost
thought. Yet it is a thing to be regretted that the habit of
scientific research and the ordinary course of town life do too often
so mould our faculties as to impede that vision which the
contemplation of Nature still brings to the simple heart. The
student's loss has its compensations, and may even involve in it an
element of the noblest sacrifice; but this cannot be said of the man
whose whole life is wrapped up in the making of money and in the
pleasures and concerns of conventional urban society. Such men are
robbing not only themselves and their families of the things which
make life worth living, but a far wider circle; for they are helping
to keep in being a civilization which deprives thousands of city
children of ever knowing what the sacraments of nature mean. The
majority of Londoners have never seen the sun rise, save over smoking
chimneys; they have never been able to watch the full moon sailing
across the clear blue of a cloudless night; never known a morning
filled with the joyous exhilaration of sunlight only dimmed by the
mist of the vanishing dew. Still less do such town-dwellers understand
of the lonely silence of the night in the [p.90] open country, in
which men may feel themselves back again amid the childhood of the
race.  True, the amber haze of day in London and the flicker of the
gas lamps in the streets at night have a beauty of their own; but it
is dearly bought if the price must be, at least for the greater part
of our poorer men and women, and for almost all the children, so heavy
a one as this. The civilization which shuts out from its gaze the
vision of the stars may well grow blind to greater mysteries; if men
will not listen to the music of the spheres, how should they hear the
angel's song?</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_VI_:"></a> CHAPTER VI: INSTITUTIONS AND
INSPIRATION</h2>
<p>ONE of the strangest and sometimes perhaps one of the saddest
things that the student of history comes to realize must surely be
that law which seems to doom every great ideal and every great
movement to give birth to organizations which, while created to
promote it, end by destroying it or diverting it to different
channels. The cynics laugh at the contrast between present-day
Christianity, as manifested in the dignity of the great historic
churches and the rude simplicity of the Galilean fishers; in a
narrower field the most sympathetic of French historians has traced
for us the tragic way in which the great spiritual forces that made
the early Franciscan movement what it was, were trammelled, if not
extinguished, by the growth of the very society which they had called
into being.</p>

<p>The mystic laments the fall from the unrealized ideal; the
statesman makes rejoinder that the change is a needful one, and a
necessary means of progress. So across the centuries contend with one
another the men of method and of discipline [p.92] and the men of
vision. Iscariot still follows in the steps of Christ, bearing his
money bags, planning his arrangements of finance, ignoring his
ideal.</p>

<p>Most of us must sympathize with Iscariot; we have so often been in
his place, sometimes in spite of ourselves, perhaps. Or if we cannot
sympathize with him, at least we must with Brother Elias, that born
master of organization, the practical man who saw the beauty of the
character of St. Francis, recognised the power of his attractive
nature, and wished to turn all to visible use, to build up around him
a great society which should be a guide to kings and prelates, a
divine strong- hold into which the beauty and the riches of the world
should be brought. Elias doubtless felt that St. Francis was too good
for this world; he himself dealt with men as men, understanding the
worth of compromise, seeing the strength of institutions. The Elias
whom most of us know well enough always tends to think of an ideal
merely in its relation to institutions actual or possible, while the
Francis, for whom we look too often in vain, thinks of the institution
only as at best the imperfect embodiment of, or the means to, the
ideal, and more often as the hindrance to be overcome on the way, "my
brother the ass," who can only be guided with difficulty.</p>

<p>It is very easy for us to recognise in a far off time the failure
of institutions to realize the ideal that inspired their origin, and
we readily admit, in the abstract, the need for the ideal to dominate
[p.93] the institution and the danger of the institution running away
with the ideal. It is harder to see in our own lives how far we are
allowing the machinery to take us from its object, how far that
machinery is out of date or out of gear, since we are in the thick of
it all, our ears dulled by the roar of the wheels. Assuming that we
admit that Iscariot has his right and helpful place, how are we to
find it and keep him there?</p>

<p>It may help us to understand the danger that follows upon
organization, if we make even a partial survey of a group of existing
institutions and try to trace the history of some one of them.</p>

<p>How great is the failure of our countless institutions intended to
promote social welfare, we to some extent realize as we take up such a
work as the "Annual Charities Register and Digest," of the Charity
Organization Society, and turn over those 700 pages describing the
various societies, with all their staffs and offices at work in the
city which is still the London that we know. Life appears almost to
become at times to some men one long committee, but, little, after
all, seems done. And this failure may be seen, to some extent at
least, even in recent movements which were originally a protest
against the narrowness and superficiality of earlier methods of
dealing with the problems of modern society. The first thought of the
men who conceived the idea of the university settlement was surely not
to found a new institution, so much as to bring life into touch [p.94]
with life, to make centres in which knowledge and experience might be
collected, and from which men and ideas might be put at the service of
all who had most need of them.  Yet, in spite of themselves, they have
almost become institutions; indeed, some settlements have frankly made
it their aim to be such, and as one reads reports from across the
water of all that our American friends are doing, one must admit that
they have been most successful in achieving their object. If the
settlement movement (as it is called) had not begun as it did twenty
odd years ago, perhaps these wonderful centres of activity would not
have come into being, or would have been very different from what they
are.  Yet would the founders of the first settlement have recognised
as their spiritual descendants these men, unselfish as they are, whose
methods are so different? Did there ever come before their vision the
picture of a great building raised by some millionaire, maintained by
like gifts, manned by a staff of salaried workers, and providing at
the expense of far-seeing or enlightened manufacturers, healthy
amusement and duly certified religious teaching and secular
instruction to the workmen of these subscribers, as well as
dispensing, on behalf of Dives, basketfuls of crumbs, both of plain
and fancy bread, to Lazarus and his fellows at the door?</p>

<p>This is, after all, an instance of a world-wide process. We are
face to face once again with the fact that men are constantly
attempting to do their [p.95] duty by deputy; to subscribe to what
they see to be a good work rather than to set about to do it
themselves, to give of their money rather than of their lives. It is
the danger that has beset the church from almost the earliest days,
that the men who should be inspiring and setting others to work have
too often simply done their work for them, or tried to do
it. Doubtless the old robber baron returning from some murderous fray
felt his heart uplifted as, rounding a comer of the road on the way to
his castle on the hill, he came in sight, in the valley below, of the
monastery he had founded, and thought of the holy lives of the monks,
and of their prayers put up daily for him, who had such need of
them. Doubtless, too, the good monks' hearts warmed towards the old
freebooter who yet had so much good in him as to be their founder and
protector. But it was small consolation to the men he robbed and put
to death to know that some part at least of their possessions would go
to Holy Church and to make possible the cloistered self-denial of
these men of God. The baron's keep has vanished, and the abbey is in
ruins, but is there not evidence that the same process is going on
to-day? It is not always pleasant to think of the ultimate source of
some of the contributions which are to be found in the subscription
lists of churches and charities. The man who realizes this may well
hesitate to appeal to the wealthy for money to aid his plans, for he
sees the effect of such methods in making [p.96] religious and social
agencies distrusted by many among the very classes which they aim at
helping. He will rather honour the spirit in which such a social
worker as Jane Addams of Chicago refuses to receive gifts of "tainted
gold," as she feels the conscience money of some unscrupulous men of
business to be. Yet here again he may be in danger of deceiving
himself. He needs, it is true, to beware of accepting, still more of
asking for, gifts which would merely be given to promote the vanity or
to further the selfish interests of the giver, but can a man so easily
wash his hands of the stain of the mammon of unrighteousness? Does he
not rather need to recognise that, indirectly at least, the fruits of
injustice enter into all the money that comes to him, since
selfishness plays the part it does in our social life, and since our
lives are so bound up with each other that no man can set himself
apart from his fellows? Only let him see that the gifts he asks for
will quicken in the givers the sense of social responsibility and
increase the desire to do and to give more themselves.</p>

<p>The payment of subscriptions, if this principle be disregarded,
becomes a soul-destroying process, alike to him that gives and him
that takes. The pious Henry III. turned once at bay, after listening
to the pleading of Friar William of Abingdon, one of the most eloquent
of the early Dominican preachers, and cried to him, "Brother William,
there was a time when thou couldst speak of spiritual things; now all
thou canst say is, [p.97] ' Give, give, give ! ' One may compare the
disgust with which a modern public schoolboy often turns from the
familiar appeal of the clergy- man who year by year comes to the
school to preach on behalf of the school mission, and to carry back
with him the usual collection, but nothing better. For the only thing
worth giving or asking is life; and such a missioner too often fails
to ask for it. Here surely we may find a hint of the explanation of
all successful social work, which is the passing on of life from life,
the result of the contact of personality with personality. In so far
as organization promotes this and makes it possible does it stand
justified, and only by this test.</p>

<p>One does not wish to undervalue the associations, the reflexes of
life, which institutions so often pass on, or the wealth of a great
past which they keep in store for us. But death is perhaps as needful
and as inevitable for the body corporate as for the individual; for
both it is often true that whom the gods love die young. It is surely
better to spend and be spent in a short life rich in ideas, than to
carry on a long existence by the aid of a comfortable endowment, which
may prevent men from realizing how far out of touch they are with the
actual needs of those about them. It is not known whether any council
of bishops has decided if there be humour in Heaven, but one is
inclined to think that the solemn way in which men shake their heads
and lament the impending decease of an outworn institution must
sometimes be greeted elsewhere by a peal of celestial laughter.</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_VII_:"></a> CHAPTER VII: PRIESTS AND
PONTIFFS</h2>
<p>SOME day we may hope to see among our great national museums one
made to illustrate the religions of the world, from the rudest rites
of the savage to the highest developments of Buddhism, Mohammedanism,
Judaism and Christianity. This museum of comparative religions does
already exist to some extent in embryo in every great collection of
antiquities, and the students of ethnology and folklore have been long
at work in preparing materials for its catalogues. A partial glimpse
of what it would contain is given in such a world-wide missionary
exhibition as that organised in connection with the work of the London
Missionary Society at the Agricultural Hall in the early summer of
1908.</p>

<p>The survey of such a great collection cannot but be stimulating to
every thoughtful student. Some of its visitors may see in the hideous
idols of the South Seas and in the pictures of the medicine man at
work at his craft only a further incentive to aid the spreading of
their own faith, which they feel more strongly than ever to be
immeasurably [p.99] raised above the rites and thoughts of the
savage. Others may look with sad eyes at the long series of pictures
that is spread out before them, for they see everywhere only the same
superstition, the primitive fears of unknown forces, developing with
the growth of civilization into religions which expand with man's own
needs and conceptions, intermingling with his hopes and aspirations
and refined by his thought into the creeds and theologies of the
higher faiths. Through all they trace the same instincts, and feel
that the savage kneeling before a blood-smeared stone explains to them
the Nicene Creed, that the hierarchy of the Church has its origin in
the spirit-doctors and fetish-men of a simpler age.</p>

<p>Yet to some at least there may come far other thoughts than these,
as they ponder over what they have seen. Everywhere they behold men
stretching out their hands towards something above them, beyond them,
struggling with fears, oppressed by dim consciousness of wrong, hoping
for some way of peace. The priest himself is a witness to this innate
need of the soul, since his very presence speaks of man's dependence
on the higher than himself, while it also shows men's interdependence
upon each other. For the priest's position is impossible, unless he is
in some way regarded as a means of communication between man and God,
and a centre of fellowship among men. With this thought in his heart a
man may look back, not without hope, upon the melancholy pageant of
[p.100] the centuries, and watch the strange part that the priest has
ever played in it. The modern sceptic joining in the sad cry of the
old Roman poet &mdash; "So many are the ills that superstition has had
power to urge men to" &mdash; has had, after all, like the rest of us,
but an imperfect vision of the confused drama of history. He sees
priesthood as a selfish influence playing upon human ignorance and
baseness; he does not perceive the wider priesthood at work of which
this is only a perversion, nor realize that priesthood and prayer
underlie all that is highest and best in human life. For priesthood is
the highest expression of man's social nature, by which he enters into
communion with his fellows and with God. It is only because we narrow
the use of the name of priest that we do not honour it aright, for in
its essence priesthood is not a profession, but a high duty to which
all are called.</p>

<p>If we were to try to define this true priesthood, might we not say
that a priest is one who, reaching out after the higher and better
than himself, helps others onward too, bringing to them something to
which they could not of themselves have attained, who shares his good
with his fellows and takes upon himself their ill, making communion
possible for them, because he has entered into communion with them
himself. But it is not easy thus to summarise in a sentence a work
which is in truth as wide as human life; wherever a man interprets
[p.101] in the terms of his own day the unseen and enduring realities,
and helps those about him to view things in their true relations, he
is performing a priestly function; whenever he takes up their
disadvantages as his own, in fellowship with suffering, and shares
with others willingly the result of their own wrong-doing, then is he
doing a part of the priest's divinest work.</p>

<p>The germ of such an ideal of priesthood may be seen in far-off
days. The family priesthood of the Hebrew patriarchs, and of the early
ages of Israel, contains, unconsciously at least, the promise of it,
and in a wider form it formed the subject of the noblest prophetic
appeal: Israel was called to be a nation of priests, revealing to
other peoples the message of God.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23"
title="">[23]</a> It may be said, too, that the later history of the
Jewish nation has shown in practice the value of the simple family
priesthood of the parent, in keeping alive a faith which from the
destruction of the temple down into the late Middle Ages was cherished
and maintained entirely without the help of a professional
ministry. Even when after the time of Maimonides, the rabbis began to
be paid for the time which they took from other work to devote to the
exposition of the Law for the benefit of others, there was still no
arbitrary division between clergy and laity. The human centre of
Jewish religious life is not the rabbinic ministry, but the lay
priesthood of the family.  [p.102]</p>

<p>It was natural that the ideal of a universal priesthood should find
expression in the earliest literature of the Christian Church,
reviving and enlarging beyond the boundaries of race the appeal of the
earlier Hebrew prophets: twice in one writing of the Apostolic
Age <a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a> are Christian
folk spoken of as a holy priesthood or a royal priest- hood, while in
the vision of the Apocalypse the same ideal is held up for the Church
that now is and for the Church that is to be, in the millennial reign
upon earth of the faithful disciples of Christ. <a href="#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> In the Pauline epistles the
disciples are not actually called priests, but both the individual
Christians and the Church as a whole are spoken of as Temples of the
Holy Spirit, and appeal is made to the Romans "that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice unto God, which is your reasonable
temple-service."<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a>
Moreover, the body in such a passage does not mean so much the flesh
and blood, as the whole visible personality of a man; in like manner
in that triumphant paean which seems to have been written by the
apostle in the conscious- ness of the nearness of impending martyrdom,
the thought in the words "I am already being poured out as a
libation" <a href="#_edn27" name= "_ednref27" title="">[27]</a> is
that his whole personality is being poured out and offered up as
[p.103] a final priestly act of cheerful giving: for the libation was
the glad offering made not merely by an official clergy, but by the
head of the household as its family priest, or by the individual as
sharing in the universal priesthood of humanity.</p>

<p>Priesthood was regarded, it would seem, in the earliest days of the
Church as a function to which all its members were called, but even in
the apostolic age certain officials were appointed to fulfil
particular duties in the Church on behalf of their fellow members. Yet
several generations appear to have passed before priest and presbyter
were regarded as fully equivalent terms.<a href="#_edn28"
name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a> As Church organization developed,
the gifts of the Spirit were conceived less and less as widespread
throughout all the parts of the body, and more and more as confined to
certain classes, while in course of time these classes became more
official and professional in character. Yet if we remember how
repeatedly institutions tend to fetter and destroy the ideal that has
created them, we shall find cause to wonder not in the growth of
clericalism in the Christian Church, but rather in the fact that all
down the ages of her continuous life men and women both within and
without the ranks of her officials have realized, in part at least,
the higher ideals of true priesthood. [p.104]</p>

<p>It is easy for us to see the harm done by the official spirit, and
the hypocrisy which is so often its shadow; still we must not forget
that noble army of men who have looked with far other eyes upon their
office, feeling themselves the representatives for the sake of order
of the Church as a whole, and realizing more or less consciously that
their duty is not to be the delegates and deputies of the layman in
discharging his priestly functions for him, but to be a means to help
him to realize them more fully, aiding him to think more, to do more
and to pray more for himself. Especially true is this of prayer, which
the true priest must ever aid in others as well as in himself, whether
the prayer find utterance in words, or remain unformed even into the
mental words of thought.  For is not prayer, in this widest sense, the
life breath of the Church and of the individual alike? Prayer is
indeed too often spoken of as though it implied words: whereas it may
exist even without conscious thought, going on whenever the soul's
hand stretches out after God, whenever man seeks after goodness, in
every act of will by which he is brought into touch with that Spirit
from whom all right thoughts, "all holy desires, all good counsels,
and all just works do proceed."</p>

<p>The aim of conscious prayer, in its highest form, must be
communion, and a communion of will which may continue when the
conscious prayer itself ceases, underlying the work and thought of
everyday life. To this communion the true priest [p.105] will ever
direct his fellows, knowing that as he and they come to share in it
more fully they will be the better able to help those about them
towards their goal. He knows too, by experience, that there is a law
of spiritual magnetism, by which just as in the physical world a weak
magnet is strengthened by contact with a strong one, so in the
spiritual world the will to do the good and to live aright may be
strengthened by coming into the presence of a stronger will, and most
of all by contact with the Divine will.</p>

<p>To the Christian, Christ expresses in human form what this will
stands for, and so for daily life he is still felt to be the High
Priest of man- kind, the touch of whose spirit polarises and renews
our wills, as they come into contact with his life. The one early
Christian writer who has developed for his readers the thought of
Christ's priesthood, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, sees in
the earlier Jewish priesthood with which he was familiar only a
somewhat imperfect type of his ideal: with thoughts turned upon the
pontifical acts of Christ, which he realizes to be the keystone and
crown of human history, he does not stay to consider how the priestly
function may, in some measure, though imperfectly, be shared by the
humblest disciple, too. Yet this thought of participation in the
highest priestly work of the Master seems to have been present with
the Apostle Paul when he spoke of "filling up that which is lacking of
the sufferings of Christ," and the same ancient [p.106] Catholic view
which sees in the good deeds of the saints the continuance of Christ's
work, the endless treasure flowing out from his life, would lead us
also to see in their sorrows and hardships, where these have been
willingly borne for the sake of God and man, a continuance of the
redemptive love of the Cross. The thought of the High Priesthood of
Christ is not lowered by the fact that priesthood, even in its highest
mediatorial side, is to some extent shared, however faultily, by every
good human life, but it is rather made intelligible to us, because it
ceases to be something wholly alien from us. The life of Christ is not
utterly isolated from the rest of the human race, for it could not be
this and remain human; it is rather the key for the Christian to all
other goodness, explaining the meaning of sacrifice, and the
possibility of sorrow and pain being made steps by which men may be
raised upwards towards God. And just as the supreme sacrifice of
Christ cannot rightly be separated from the rest of his ministry, but
rather is understood as its consummation, concentrating upon Calvary
the work which was the aim of all his life, so is his High Priesthood
not something foreign and separate from the life of man, but the
manifestation of a principle which is at work wherever good men live
and die. Yet the more truly his followers have become priests
themselves, the more have they realized how imperfect their priesthood
is, how deep their need to find it constantly renewed by contact with
the [p.107] unique and perfect high-priesthood which they find in
Christ.</p>

<p>The close vital connection between the disciples' work and that of
their Master is one of the thoughts most prominent in the last great
discourse of Christ to his disciples as pictured in the Fourth Gospel,
and it is emphasized in what commentators have called the great
priestly prayer. The disciples' lives are to be in close union with
their Master's as the vine branches with the parent stem, and beneath
all their deeds must flow his living spirit. They must be in union
with each other as he is one with the Divine Father, so making real to
others the continuance of his life. Their whole lives are to be one
great act of priesthood realizing itself through fellowship. For
without fellowship priesthood cannot be, and Christianity could not
exist. The Church is a society in which men are linked to each other
and to God through Christ; there is no place in it for the selfishness
of isolated individualism, or the centring of thought upon personal
salvation alone. Its members belong to each other in belonging to
their head. The metaphors used in the apostolic writings to describe
the Church are all social; it is a body, a building, a city, a
kingdom, in which every part is in relation to others, and only thus
can join to make the whole. The more the children of the Church
realize this, the more truly will they become a fellowship of friends,
and show themselves such in daily life; theirs will be [p.108] no
exclusive friendship, but one which overflows to all, in honest
sincerity, because they cannot but work for all men's good.</p>

<p>When Christ went about in Galilee and told men. that the Kingdom of
Heaven was at hand, was he mistaken? Or is the fellowship which he
founded not itself a part of that kingdom, the seed which is already
growing and spreading throughout the whole earth? Many strange fowls,
perhaps, we may think, have lodged in its branches already; but if the
fellowship be strong and true they cannot do it great harm, and under
its shelter may live not only these but a host of singing birds. The
great thing that all have to remember is that members of the
fellowship must needs hand on to others the life that has been given
to them. That great title by which the Pope is known as Vicar of
Christ upon earth is not an idle one: every good Christian Pope has
been that to some extent, and so, too, has every Christian disciple,
in so far as he lives in the Master's spirit. For language grows old
so quickly, that we forget that the vicar is one who acts instead of
another, in his place, just as vicarious suffering is suffering borne
by one on behalf and instead of another. But we need to explain and
translate the appellation "Vicar of Christ" into daily life by means
of that other noble title which shines like a jewel at the head of
every Papal bull and rescript "servus servorum Dei," servant of the
servants of God. The Vicar of Christ will show himself such by serving
his [p.109] fellow-men with his whole life, ungrudgingly and gladly,
knowing that every act and thought given to their welfare is given to
God, and that the Father would have men seek Him not afar from human
life and labour, but amidst the toil and sorrow of that sinful
humanity for whom Christ died.</p>

<p>When we seek to find how far this ideal is being carried out within
the Christian Church, we may well be saddened by our own failure, and
by the way in which organizations intended for the common service have
come to be treated as an end in themselves. Yet we must remember that
in the ancient liturgies, which seem sometimes hard for the democratic
modern mind to under- stand, the priest does not speak or act for
himself, but as a representative of the whole fellowship of the
Church; the cries and prayers and strivings of long generations of
human lives are joined in the words of the prayers that he uses, and
the beautiful ritual of the altar is intended to be a living picture
of spiritual symbols, full of meaning not only for himself, but for
all who worship with him.</p>

<p>This view of prayer finds fitting expression in a sonnet of Hartley
Coleridge on The Liturgy, which deserves to be better known.</p>

<p><em>Oft as I hear the Apostolic voice</em></p>

<p><em>Speaking to God, I blame my heart so cold,</em></p>

<p><em>That with those words, so good, so pure and old,</em></p>

<p><em>Cannot repent, nor hope, far less rejoice.</em> [p.110]</p>

<p><em>Yet am I glad, that not the vagrant choice,</em></p>

<p><em>Chance child of impulse, timid or too bold,</em></p>

<p><em>The volume of my heart may dare unfold</em></p>

<p><em>With figured rhetoric or unmeaning noise</em></p>

<p><em>Praying for all in those appointed phrases,</em></p>

<p><em>Like a vast river, from a thousand fountains</em></p>

<p><em>Swoll'n with the waters of the lakes and mountains,</em></p>

<p><em>The pastor bears along the prayers and praises</em></p>

<p><em>Of many souls in channel well defined,</em></p>

<p><em>Yet leaves no drop of prayer or praise behind.</em></p>

<p>We cannot but sympathize with the poet: so powerful and attractive
are the ancient words that have come to us down the ages fraught with
the memories of man's need and spiritual striving, so unworthy often
do we feel the language of extempore prayer. Yet if we have only once
or twice experienced what unpremeditated prayer may be, when it is
offered in the true priestly spirit, in deep sympathy with the needs
and longings of those present, diverse though they be, and in close
harmony with the peculiar demands of the time and place, we know how
such prayer can, as nothing else, gather up our hidden desires and
bring our whole souls with it into the sense of communion with the
source of the strength and help that we need, towards which our arms
stretch out as we listen, and are not stretched in vain.</p>

<p>It is easy for us to see how often priesthood in worship has come
short of its ideal; still sadder surely has been our failure to make
real the priest- hood of daily life. A family priesthood of the
simplest kind has been for centuries characteristic of Hebrew
religious life, and this household priest- [p.111] hood of the father,
or of both father and mother, is a very real thing in Christendom,
especially where the influence of the Reformation is strongest. But we
need not only this intimate and beautiful priesthood, but one which
shall extend to the wider families of the city, the nation and
mankind. We have to remember that our lives are not our own, that we
are each representatives, and that every act of ours must have
pontifical significance for others; more than that our very thoughts
and desires go out far beyond our own lives and help to weave cords
which shall pull others upwards or drag them down to our level. The
words of Christ's prayer in the Gospel "For their sakes I sanctify
myself" are full of significance. If the Master thus consecrates his
life and overcomes the evil, thrusting aside the temptation to take
the lower and easier path and dedicating his whole will and nature to
the Divine will, in order that his disciples may be helped to reach
unity with each other and with him, then must the disciples too
understand that their own efforts after a better and cleaner and more
unselfish life are not made for themselves alone. There is no man that
fights in the secret of his own life against evils and temptations, of
which others can know nothing, but may feel cheered to remember that
his is, after all, no lonely battle. He is an outpost, hidden from his
fellow combatants perhaps, but his welfare concerns the whole company,
his victory is not for one life, but for all. In this spirit surely
[p.112] in every act and thought of life a man may be made a
priest.</p>

<p>How beautiful an idea that was which in ancient Rome made of
bridge-building a religious deed, so that the chief bridge-builder,
the Pontifex Maximus, was also the chief priest. Nor was the thought
that bridge-building was a sacred act wholly lost with Paganism, for
in the middle ages amongst the many religious societies which existed
to promote human welfare and to lessen by sharing them the burdens of
life, was the Order of Pontiff Brothers or bridge-builders. Perhaps
such societies as this came into being more especially to make easier
the perilous pilgrims' roads along which men must pass to visit the
holy places and shrines of the Saints. Sometimes a pilgrim who had
made the journey would join himself with others who had realized its
hardships to make the way lighter for those who should follow in their
steps. Sometimes, it may be, men who had not the time or money and
perhaps lacked even the courage to make the perilous voyage
themselves, yet gladly gave of their labour to help to build the
bridge. They could never make use of it, but they hoped that others,
better men and more fortunate than they, would pass over it to behold
the holy sights which they themselves might never see, and long after
they were dead their work would thus stand fast. Thus the great bridge
of Avignon still rests on the piers built seven hundred years ago by
the Pontiff Brothers, and the feet of [p.113] the little children
dance over the arches which the pilgrims used to tread.</p>

<p>To many of the early bridges there still cling memories which tell
of some noble founder, but there is a peculiar beauty in the story of
the building of the Bridge of Avignon by Saint Benezet. Of this Saint
Benezet, or Little St. Benedict, for the friendly pet name can but
imperfectly be rendered into English, we know only a little; but
across the mists of tradition we catch a glimpse of him, a boy tending
the sheep upon the distant hillside and there receiving a strange
heavenly call, bidding him go build a bridge where none had yet been,
across the broad river at Avignon, where hitherto men had crossed the
Rhone often with peril, and always with toil. Shepherd's staff in
hand, the lad came to Avignon and entered the church; there he spoke
his message to bishop and people, and pleaded with them to help build
the bridge. Bishop and people were incredulous, and so too was the
mayor when appeal was made to him, but Benezet persisted, and little
by little men began to help him. They tell of how he was in some way
able to raise the big stones and to lift weights which others failed
to move. The first piers began to rise; Benezet and others joined the
Order of Pontiff Brothers and under his guidance the work went on. It
was the labour of years, and of immense effort, and before the bridge
was completed its boy builder died and they buried him in a little
chapel above one of the great piers. But [p.114] the building went on,
the spirit that Benezet had brought to it did not die with him, and in
due time the bridge was built, where men would have toiled and
struggled still with the waters, but for the faithfulness of a
shepherd boy.</p>

<p>In the old Pagan days, at least in many lands, the priestly act of
bridge-building had its darker side. Here and there a curious
tradition still survives to show that once the making of a bridge was
accompanied by the sacrifice of a life. The victim was offered to
propitiate the jealous powers which otherwise might wreak their
vengeance upon a larger number, destroying the bridge and the
passengers upon it by some sudden storm or earthquake.</p>

<p>We have ceased to think the gloomy thoughts which made men build
their bridges thus in the ancient ages. But still, if the bridge of
life is to be well and truly laid, there must be sacrifice at its
foundations. The thought of the architect, the beauty of the curving
arch, all may crumble and fall in the time of stress when the floods
are out and the river rushes in boisterous strength against the piers,
if the bridge-builder has not done his priestly duty. It is good that
man's life should be well ordered, clean and happy, useful to others
and harmonious in itself, but deep down in it, if the life is to stand
the strain of evil days and to do its full service, there must surely
be the strength of willing sacrifice. The ideal of such Christian
sacrifice is no sullen, grudging surrender [p.115] of desire, no
mutilation of man's true nature, but the glad gift of life to life,
which mingles vicarious sorrow with vicarious joy. And as this spirit
spreads with the growth of that Kingdom of God which Christ proclaimed
to men, the human race will realize more and more fully all that is
meant by the priesthood of humanity.</p>

<p>[p.116]</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_VIII_:"></a> CHAPTER VIII: THE ANSWER OF
FAITH</h2>
<p>CENTURIES ago, in a far-off Eastern land, a philosopher poet set to
verse the sad music of his heart's doubts and longings, and the cry
that rings again and again through his poems finds an echo in men's
hearts to-day. The mystery of life and death over which Omar Khayam
pondered has never ceased to attract the thoughts of men.  Returning
spring brings the old hopes back to our lives, sometimes with the same
sadder echoes that troubled Moschus and Horace, and still thinkers and
poets bow before the terror and the majesty of death which they are
powerless to explain.</p>

<p>What use then is it to trouble ourselves with a problem which is as
old as the life of man and which the greater intellects have failed to
solve? Think about it we must, again and again, unless we deliberately
stifle our thoughts when they turn to the things which matter most to
us. And since we are social beings, born dependent on each other and
made to help one another, it is natural that we should wish to share
our thoughts. [p.117]</p>

<p>Whence? and whither? and why? is a triad of questions over which
men have broken their hearts; in a sense they must always remain un
answered, or at least incompletely answered; and yet as long as men
have made them, one response at least has brought with it peace.</p>

<p>The problem of life and death was stated long ages before Omar's
day by another Eastern thinker, and with a poignancy greater at times
than his. Nowhere in Hebrew literature do we get a deeper sense of the
gloomy mystery of life than in the book of Ecclesiastes, where again
and again the writer makes lament over triumphant injustice, and the
end that comes alike to good and bad.  There passes before his eyes
the melancholy pageant of the children of men, journeying along
through the ages to the common goal of endless oblivion. "All things
come alike to all," he cries; "there is one event to the righteous and
to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him
that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so
is the sinner; and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath. This
is an evil that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto
all; yea, also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and
madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to
the dead." And so too, he goes on to speak of death as annihilation
which puts the noblest of dead creatures below the basest of the
living. Probably most men have known some [p.118] dark hour at least
in which the tragedy of life comes home to them, and they have
wondered whether after all the old thinker was not right. We take up
as our own the refrain of Omar:</p>

<p><em>I came like water, and like wind I go,</em></p>

<p><em>Into this Universe and why not knowing,</em></p>

<p><em>Nor whence, like water willy-nilly flowing,</em></p>

<p><em>And out of it as wind along the waste,</em></p>

<p><em>I know not whither, willy-nilly blowing.</em></p>

<p>Again there echo about us out of the past those ancient questions
to which the mind of man is ever framing answers, ever finding
unsatisfying those which others have made. How then can religion help,
if even with its presence those answers still remain incomplete?</p>

<p>When faith comes into our hearts, the mystics may tell us,
uncertainty does not go out of them. We are still facing an unknown
future, and have no more knowledge of the past than have our
fellows. But a new factor has come into our consciousness. We are able
to go back and face the old questions, and lo, they no longer seem to
cut, as once they did, at the roots of our being. We have hold of
something which goes deeper than doubt can reach, or fear can fall
to. And strangely enough, the very same metaphor which Omar uses to
express his despair comes from the lips of faith, but with how
different a meaning:</p>

<p>"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou nearest the sound
thereof, and canst not tell [p.119] whence it cometh and whither it
goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit."</p>

<p>Beneath the unanswered question now, there is the abiding sense of
the reality that endures, a conviction that, though we do not
understand its purpose, life is not purposeless, and that though we
cannot lift the veil of death it is only a covering which hides from
our eyes a wider and greater world than ours.</p>

<p>It may be that some will feel that all such talk of faith is
meaningless to them. Religion and faith convey no such notions to
their minds as they seem to imply to others. What they want is the
clear demonstration, which a physicist might give us. If life goes on
after death there must surely be some proof of it.</p>

<p>If we try and look at life merely from the stand-point of the
physiologist, we do indeed perceive that we only observe it in
connection with certain structures of organic matter, and that, as far
as we are able to see, every act of human conscious ness is
accompanied by certain processes and changes in the grey tissues of
the brain. When those tissues are injured, the expression of this
consciousness is interfered with, and when a certain condition of the
brain material comes about life ceases, as far as our observation
goes. So far as we can observe, indeed, every act of life is
accompanied by and connected with some material condition, or at least
some material concomitant. But this is as far as the physi- [p.120]
ologist can take us. What life is he is still unable to say. To speak
of life as energy, and to say that energy is a potential property of
matter, is only to hide from ourselves with words the fact that life
can only be explained to us in terms of life: the physicists cannot
tell us what life is.</p>

<p>If we admit that we cannot explain what it is in its ultimate
nature, we are yet all of us conscious enough of what we mean
ourselves by life. The word has a real significance to us, although we
cannot define it or explain it in any way.</p>

<p>Can we then find any answer from physical science as to whether or
no our life continues when the bodily change which we call death
happens? Since life is always connected, as far as we are able to
observe it, with certain physical conditions of the body, can it
continue when those conditions are no longer present?</p>

<p>There have been many thinkers impressed by the sense of a universe
governed by necessary and unchanging laws, who have felt that they
could only answer that since life is in our experience always
accompanied by certain material conditions, it must cease to exist
when those conditions have been removed.</p>

<p>There is one great assumption, however, which consciously or
unconsciously underlies this position, that the only universe which
exists is one that is intelligible to our thought, and that something
[p.121] which we cannot possibly understand, necessarily cannot
possibly exist.</p>

<p>But there is yet another thought which seems to have escaped such a
thinker: the possibility of the co-existence of more than one world
and of life passing from one world to another.  Mathematicians have
already shown the possibility of this by discussing the existence of a
fourth dimension, and even working out problems involving the
assumption of the existence of this fourth dimension. The suggestion
has been made especially easy to grasp in the remarkable anonymous
romance "Flatland," published some thirty years ago, which pictures
the world of two dimensions, wherein one person gets the notion of the
existence of a third dimension, and the extraordinary results that
follow his heresy, or madness, as it seems to his less enlightened
fellows.</p>

<p>If the theory of the existence of another, or other dimensions be a
tenable one, we can conceive of the existence of a number of worlds
around us, co-existing with our own and including it, of which we are
either wholly unconscious or only very dimly conscious, and that not
by the faculties by means of which we have knowledge of our own
world.</p>

<p>Now if we suppose that somewhere within us, at the centre of our
lives, is some meeting-point, some door through which we may have
contact with these other worlds and pass out into them, [p.122] we can
also conceive of a development growing out from this point of contact
into that larger life of which we should necessarily remain
unconscious here, or even if our whole nature were suddenly to be
filled by a consciousness of how its life extended beyond this
universe into those other worlds, we should yet be unable to express
in terms of our own world this wider life, or could only express it by
symbols. The incapacity of our friends to understand our experience
would be no proof that it was not true, nor would our own inability to
express it in any way lessen the reality of that experience to us. If
such a hypothesis be correct, what may happen at death may be that we
pass out of the narrower world of three dimensions into the wider
world, which includes this and much more.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at the problem has been to conceive of our
various senses as channels through which we have entered into
communication with the world without us. At present we most of us are
only conscious of five such channels. We may conceive of the
possibility of many other channels of which we have no experience (and
indeed observation of certain living creatures has already led to the
hypothesis of a sixth sense, different from any of our own), and we
can also think of the channels as being one by one closed.  So that at
death we may conceive of all our existing lines of communication with
the outer world being removed, and wholly new channels, with [p.123]
what may seem like an entirely different world, being opened
up.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title= "">[29]</a></p>

<p>Such an explanation of the working of our universe is but a
hypothesis. Yet after all, it may to some extent help us to understand
phenomena otherwise very difficult to explain. Are not the mystics and
seers, the inspired poets and prophets, just those whose lives are
more in touch than ours with a world we cannot see, often able only
imperfectly to express themselves, but yet conscious of vast realities
beyond our ken? And may we not to some extent look upon faith as such
a faculty, or sixth sense, taking hold of the unseen and translating
it into our own life?</p>

<p>But all have not this faith, it may be urged; it is strongest often
when the intellectual powers are weak enough, and men of the greatest
genius tell us they are wholly without it. Yet cannot we conceive of a
community of people almost wholly devoid of one of our own five
senses, say that of hearing? How difficult it would be for one of them
whose ears were suddenly opened to explain to his friends the new
world about him. Imagine these people watching a skylark, and looking
on with astonishment at the joy of the one man who heard it singing. A
dull brown bird flying aimlessly up into the air: why should he look
on it [p.124] with such wonder? They see all that he sees, and if he
should try to explain his feelings as he listens to its song, will
they not one and all be convinced that he is mad, or that he is at
best only recounting some subjective illusion? If he would convince
them, let him translate into terms of sight these curious
sensations. He cannot do it, and they can only pity his condition.</p>

<p>This may help us to realize how narrow a view that is of life which
conceives of this world of our consciousness as the only one which
exists. It may even help us to frame a physical hypothesis of another
life; but this is not enough for our need. If we are to go to the
centre of the problem we must turn not to physical difficulties, but
to the moral and spiritual ones. It is above all in its failure to
solve the problems of our inward life that the materialistic
explanation of the world breaks down.</p>

<p>All the explanations thus suggested have been too much akin to the
physical one to touch the heart of the problem. It is when we realize
the meaning of faith in our own lives here and now, that we cease to
trouble about the future. In the realization of the supreme value of
goodness, and the infinite meaning of it, we begin to understand that
it must endure, in a sense far deeper than mere extension in time or
space.</p>

<p>Faith is the organ of spiritual apprehension, and comes into play
whenever we recognise in practice the claim of the ethical ideal as
opposed [p.125] to the materialistic, when the will to do the good
triumphs over the desire to get the good for our selves.  In every act
of the inward life by which being is set above having, and by which
our own visible happiness is subordinated to that of our fellows,
there comes into play this activity of the soul which we call faith,
by which we come into contact with that which underlies our hopes, and
put to test the things we do not see.
<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a></p>

<p>As this faith comes to dominate and control our lives we are able
to reach a point at which the old doubts cease to pain us. We may
still repeat to ourselves the riddle of life, and seek for an answer;
but though we may continue to puzzle to find an explanation, we are
conscious that we have known something in the presence of which the
ancient questionings cease to trouble. We feel that somehow we have
come into touch with a presence which brings with it the solution of
the greatest of all problems. In the depths of our lives we listen to
the answer of faith.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the very words which ring with such a sense of
awful despair in the poem of Omar may express nothing but peace to one
who has gone through this experience: "He knows about it all, He
knows, He knows." The difference lies in this, that to Omar there is
as he writes no sense of contact with the Unseen, the Omniscient, in
whose power he lies; but to him who [p.126] has heard the answer of
Faith that sense of contact has come. He knows that in this deepest
experience God has come into touch with him, and henceforth life to
him both came and goes, out of God's hand into God's hand.</p>

<p>When Christ was confronted by the sceptical Sadducees with the
problem of human life enduring beyond the grave, he pointed to their
faith that the heroes of old time, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, had had
knowledge of God, and told them that this knowledge of God meant
life. A being that has come to have communion with the Eternal cannot
be conceived of as passing away with the changing husk of things, the
accidents of the body and the outer world.  Eternal life does not
consist in the duration for ever of an accidental process. If we could
conceive of a jelly-fish continuing thus an indefinite existence,
which should involve neither inward development nor the possession of
higher powers than such a creature is commonly believed to be capable
of, we should still surely be unable to speak of such existence as
eternal life. For what we mean by this is not the mere continuity of
existence from a present of transient accidents into a like future,
but something which goes beyond death because it goes beyond life too,
as life is ordinarily pictured.</p>

<p>But can we hope to tread ourselves this way of the Divine life?
There are times when, the spiritual end which is ever present in our
lives makes itself evident to us, and now and again [p.127] across the
centuries come periods when the latent desires of men seem to come to
the surface. Such was that epoch of spiritual unrest and stirring
which came to England in the seventeenth century, in which the Quaker
and Quietest movements had their birth, and it may be that we are not
far away from the dawn of such another age to-day. Now, as then, men
turn from orthodoxy in search of something deeper and wider than its
mere creeds can give. The works of the old mystics are reissued from
the press, and in the by-ways of literature men are seeking for paths
that may lead them to inward peace. It is still twilight time. No
prophet's voice is clearly heard calling us towards the full light of
the day, but our eyes turn towards the horizon and watch for the signs
of dawn.</p>

<p>We share a common life, and our need to-day is the same, though we
may express it in different ways. We are conscious of something
lacking in our lives, sensible at least at times of the evil there.
We feel the darkness about us, and long for light and for a power that
shall take us out of our lower natures, upward and onward. At such
moments we may earnestly desire to come ourselves into communion with
God, that his life may flow into ours and transform it. But how, after
all, are we to attain to some dim realization of this knowledge of God
which illumines the lives of the great mystics and brings peace to-day
to many a life which otherwise would be full of painful failure?
[p.128] Perhaps another saying from the book of Ecclesiastes may put
us upon the path to find the answer. It is one of those words which
come sometimes to poet and thinker, bearing within them fuller depth
of meaning than was clear to the writer who first framed them, groping
as he may have been at the edge of some great truth which he has never
consciously apprehended. "Also He hath set Eternity in their
heart." <a href= "#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a> The
words were written in sadness, but there is within them the promise of
hope. There lies at once the key to the mystery of human unrest and
the hope for some deeper peace than the world without can
give. Somewhere in the depths of his own life every man is in touch
with the Eternal.  Sometimes we are conscious of this higher reality
surrounding us, as pervading all about us; on some glorious day alone
with Nature the wonder of the world flashes upon us, and all things
become radiant with a new light which fills both us and them. Or
silently in the quiet of the night, before the mystery of the starry
sky, a great peace comes over us in which our own tiny life seems to
take its place amidst the ordered harmony of all the spheres.</p>

<p>But we come, too, to a vision of the Infinite in other ways;
whenever we see a good deed done, and behold its goodness, we are
touching the hem of the robe of the Eternal. In the inward recognition
of the supreme beauty of unselfish love we are directly conscious of a
flash of intuition [p.129] which illumines not the intellect alone,
but our whole nature. We are brought into touch with God at the very
centre of our lives. Nature is indeed the priest of the Eternal, and
every high place has still its altar, where we may worship in spirit
and in truth. But in an even deeper sense is the priesthood given to
man. There is no man but is called to that true temple service wherein
every good act is filled with meaning, not for himself only, but for
his fellows. Every pure and unselfish deed is sacramental, bringing
the soul of him who beholds it into touch with the God who inspired
the act. And this contact with the Divine through goodness in another
may come to us in spite of all intellectual barriers. If with our
whole heart we honour a good deed done our nature does obeisance to
the God who is working within it, who makes the deed of worth. Unknown
to ourselves, we are drawn nearer to Him, and His life touches our
lives, and transforms them a little nearer to His likeness. For every
pure and lovely act that men do is not only a revelation but an
inspiration and an influence drawing others upward. We have never had
trust enough in the infectious power of a good deed.</p>

<p>Thus as we are faithful to the highest it has been given us to see,
our sight will be strengthened to see further: at the moment of vision
we are conscious that in the presence of the good thought, the good
personality, we are in contact with the source of strength that we
need. We must keep [p.130] close to the same source when the darkness
is about us.</p>

<p>It is surely this truth that has helped to make the worship of the
Saints the power for good which it has been in the lives of devout
souls within the Catholic Church of Rome and of the East.  They have
done reverence to that in the Saints which was of God, and in drawing
near to them they have been drawn near to Him also.  The worship of
the Saints has done harm, not only in the case of the false reverence
of the market place, but whenever it has led men to turn from the
source of the saint's power to the accidentals of his life and
character, and to imitate the man, rather than to get into touch with
his spirit. But the words of the old Creed, "I believe in the Holy
Catholic Church," express a great reality. We can get the greatest
help from this belief in the dark hours of the soul, and in all times
of transition to fuller knowledge of the truth, if by belief in the
Church we mean belief in the whole body of those who have come into
touch with God through Christ, and through his spirit, and who can be
recognised as his disciples because they bear in their lives his
likeness. As we believe in the Church in this sense, we shall strive
to feel the inner bond of union that connects together the good and
holy of all creeds and nations, and to bring our lives into harmony
with the same spirit of unity.</p>

<p>Men who have shown singular devotion to some [p.131] hero saint
whom they love may have erred in the past in trying to reproduce his
life under altered conditions; and such imitation has sometimes led
them all too far from the spirit of the one whom they have sought to
follow. St. Francis of Assisi, and in later days John Wycliffe, and
George Fox, have each had followers such as these.  But there is at
least one to whom we may look for this guidance without any of the
narrowing influence that other hero worship so often brings. We cannot
read about our heroes, look up to them and think of them, without
coming under the influence of their personality and without our
character growing unconsciously to bear in it some faint trace at
least of theirs. Let us then turn thus in the dark hour to Jesus
Christ. No matter if for the moment we cannot regard him as we have
been taught the Church does. Let us put aside all theories as to his
birth; the miracles which puzzle us, even the fact of the
Resurrection, and the speculations of theology as to his Divine
nature. Not because these are not important matters, and not because
we may not have to go on thinking about them, and seeking more light
about them; but because for the guidance which most of all we need we
can go deeper than all these doubts and speculations. Let us make
Christ our teacher as his earliest disciples did, who knew nothing
about his birth, and only followed him at first just because they felt
he was far better than they and they had need of him and loved
him. [p.132] As we do this, and simply endeavour to keep near to his
thoughts, to think over the meaning of his words and to act as men who
are seeking to follow him, we shall begin to realize that there is in
Christ himself a greater miracle than anything recorded of him in the
Gospels, and that whatever the correct theory of the Resurrection may
be, He is still a living influence working upon our hearts and
inspiring us onward to good. When we doubt of God because of the
world's evil, we can hear his voice speak of the love which watches
even over the fall of the sparrow, and some sense of that love comes
to us too, in the midst of our darkness.  And when the sense of our
own wrong-doing is heavy upon us, we may feel cheered to think that
our Teacher never turned from the men of the world and the profligate
when they sought his help in honest sorrow, but rather sought them
first, and for the disciple who denied him had nothing but a look of
love. He knew what it was himself to be discouraged, to spend long
hours in prayer, to be misunderstood and to fail. And sometimes there
may come to us a glimpse of even deeper depths into which he went for
his fellow- men. As we feel all this we may not be able to explain it,
but we know ourselves the stronger for it, the better able to face
misfortune and temptation and suffering, and to hold manfully to the
best that we know, in the midst of doubt. And thus, little by little,
we come to feel we have found one who not only makes us realize what
failures [p.133] we have been, but is ever calling out the best that
is in us, drawing us on to a higher ground and clearer air, where our
vision carries further, until at length there may come to us some
glimpse of the Divine Love at work in the world and within us, and
some sense that Christ has brought to us God's expression of Himself
in the terms of humanity, so that we begin to understand a little of
the meaning of the words: "This is life eternal, that they may know
Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent."</p>

<p>And meanwhile, let us have faith too for those who cannot yet feel
this attractive power as we, perhaps, have known it. In the Fourth
Gospel the Master tells his disciples that he has other sheep who are
not of this fold; we may picture his thought as going out to far-off
lands where men were striving to do their duty or to find the truth
without any knowledge of him, without any intellectual knowledge of
God perhaps; some legionary guarding the peace of the empire at the
gates of the North, some Roman government official upholding the
dignity and justice of the law amongst jealous robber tribes and
unscrupulous traders, some Greek philosopher seeking to know a yet
higher law, and simple men and women practising it unknown to
themselves; or, further away in the far-off East, the Buddhist
missionary teaching the worth of gentleness and mercy, or the disciple
of Confucius learning to reverence the great moral truths he knew, and
to apply them [p.134] in all life's relations. Some day all these
should hear his voice; already they were his sheep. And so to-day,
wherever the lonely thinker spends his hours in seeking, and the
servant of science unselfishly gives up all thought of personal
advancement and delight in the pursuit of truth, wherever in the
politics of towns or peoples men seek to work out a higher form of
public life, or in business as in leisure to be faithful not merely to
their own interests, but to a wider ideal, we must see the seekers and
servants of good, who are God's servants too. Sooner or later for
these too will be fulfilled the words: "Blessed are they that have not
seen and yet have believed."</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_IX.:_THE"></a> CHAPTER IX.: THE HOUSE OF
PEACE.</h2>
<p>THE sense of ancient peace, the quiet beauty of the ruined abbeys
which Turner and many a lesser artist loved to paint, must often have
come home to many who visit them, who have no knowledge of
architecture and little thought for history. But, even with these
passers by, something of their interest in the old ruin is perhaps due
to the thought of the life which was lived there in the days gone
by. Less worthy traditions have marred the glory of the earlier days,
and dimmed the recollection of the long struggle with nature, the
hardships of a simple, self-denying life, the toil of the scholar and
the conflicts of the saint, but as we look at the broken pillars and
the silent aisles and arches where once the music of men's chanting
rose and fell, we feel that it is not only the thought of the vanished
greatness that moves us, but the sense that this was a place where
prayer was wont to be made. We try to picture to our selves sometimes
the life of mediaeval England, and how these ruins were once places
living and vibrating with thought and spiritual effort, centres
[p.136] from which pulsed out many a good influence to uplift the
lives of men.</p>

<p>It is true that the monastic ideal was in some respects narrow and
one-sided, that its social and religious life was marred and maimed by
an artificial celibacy being put in the place of the natural family
life; but granting all this, had not the monastery at its best a noble
place in the nation, which is too often lacking to-day, or but
imperfectly supplied by other things?</p>

<p>The rule of St. Benedict prescribed that seven hours daily should
be given by each disciple to manual labour; it was a far-seeing
provision, in which there seems to have been realized the thought that
study and prayer alone without active work could not provide a
complete and healthy life. The Benedictine and Cistercian Abbeys were,
at their best, never self-centred institutions whose members pursued
their own spiritual welfare without regard to the needs of the world
outside. Their scholars copied manuscripts and wrote books for the
instruction of men, they were schoolmasters to rich and poor; their
lay brothers laboured in the fields, making waste places smooth. Their
intercessions went up for others than themselves. Every now and then
guests from the great world came to stay within the abbey walls for
rest and refreshment of soul, and now and then to end their days in an
atmosphere of prayer and peace. In some ways, as we know, the coming
of the Friars marked a stage of higher development, in that they
[p.137] shared more fully the life of the people, at least in the
simplicity and poverty of the early days of the Franciscan
movement. Yet another development again is seen in the communities of
Brethren of the common life, and in the béguinages of the Low
Countries, which combined something of the possibility of individual
home life with a common union for prayer.</p>

<p>It is interesting to be able to see at Ghent and Bruges to-day
these quaint communities, where each inmate has her own house, with
perfect liberty to come and go, to mix with the outer world, or even
to return to it altogether; but with a common chapel, and a common
religious bond visibly uniting the whole sisterhood. Is it not
possible, if the Reformation of Henry VIII. had not been so largely
political in its origin, that the monastic system might have been in
some measure adapted to the needs of the world of to-day without those
acts of spoliation which gave the new Tudor aristocracy its wealth and
left us these piles of ruined buildings?</p>

<p>A famous French novelist who had lived and written as a
materialist, turned in his closing years back to the ancient Catholic
Church, finding peace and refreshment as a lay guest within the walls
of a monastery. Much of his later work may seem exaggerated, and even
morbid, in its mysticism, but it was sincere because based upon his
own inward experience. In one of these later religious novels he
speaks of cloistered convents [p.138] as being "the spiritual
lightning conductors of Europe." To him the lives of these poor women,
shut off in perpetuity from their fellows, were not wasted, but
provided a sacrifice of spiritual struggle on behalf of the erring
world outside.</p>

<p>Perhaps Huysmans was not right in thinking that the self-inflicted
loneliness of the Poor Clares and Benedictine nuns stood in so high a
relation of service to humanity as he pictures; certainly the life of
practical prayer lived out by a faithful sister of St. Vincent de Paul
amongst the sick poor whom she tends, seems far higher and more
Christlike than that of the cloistered ascetic; but still the fact
remains that if we are not materialists, but have faith in the
effectual working of all true prayer we must hold that the
intercessions of the cloister, in so far as they spring from true
hearts of faith, are not wasted, but, in some way we cannot
understand, flow out for the uplifting of the world.</p>

<p>As we look out at the life of to-day must we not feel that in its
rush and hurry, with the thoughtless materialism of its outlook, there
is more than ever need for the essential message of the monastery,
fellowship in self-surrender and self-control, comradeship in study,
work and above all in prayer? Is it not possible for us even now to
have in our midst here and there little colonies which will do for our
age the work which the best monasteries did for the Middle Ages, and
perhaps [p.139] something more even than this, in that we need no
longer have their limitations?</p>

<p>What would such a monastery be, if we can picture it in its main
features?</p>

<p>The first monks were always anxious to have their cells built in
some out of the way spot, and sometimes moved the site of their abbeys
to avoid the dangers to their inward life which seemed to them to come
with the invasions of sounds and sights, which the approach of "the
world" brought with it. We do not now believe in the separation of the
life of the Church from that of men outside it, and there was at
times, perhaps, some thing selfish in the monkish love of quiet
isolation, but for certain high purposes of the monastery there was a
sound instinct in it too. If the community remains in living touch
with those without, sending its members out from it and receiving
guests on visits long or short, it will, in many cases, do its work
best if its situation provides it with a natural atmosphere and
background of peace and quiet, corresponding to that inward atmosphere
which is to play around the life of its members.</p>

<p>Our monastery then will be placed in some little frequented spot,
if possible close to one of those natural bridges over which we may
most easily pass into communion with the life of nature unmarred by
man's civilization; at the edge of some rolling heather moorland,
where for miles you may walk and see no sign of house or road, under a
ridge [p.140] of the limestone fells, or beneath the shadow of a great
chalk down, where the sheep wander freely, or if mountain and moor be
too far away, within reach of some solitary beach where the sea and
wind sing to each other; or with an outlook over some wide plain, with
broad horizons giving some sense of openness and freedom.</p>

<p>Thus the companions of the House of Peace will have constantly near
them the opportunity of silent intercourse with nature; they can go
out, wet or fine, sometimes alone and sometimes in company, to let the
fresh winds and the sunlight and the spirit of the great open spaces
play about them, making them stronger and fitter for joy and labour,
for study, work and prayer.</p>

<p>For the House of Peace will be a dwelling place where work is
done. It will have its garden, with flowers and fruit trees to be
tended, kitchen herbs to be raised; there will be beehives and
poultry, and it may be the cares of a small farm; but beast and bird
will be treated as friendly companions, objects of the Divine care and
therefore, too, of the good will and reverence of the dwellers in the
House.</p>

<p>There will be books: especially such as will help most the inner
life of man, the <em>Acta sanctorum</em>, and all stories of the
saints of God; the records of other religions than ours, the works of
philosophers, poets and thinkers; and such a general library as would
befit a home whose windows look out on to many sides of life.</p>

<p>[p.141]</p>

<p>But it will not be enough for the House to be supplied with
opportunity for fruitful study, quiet cells for work and meditation,
and with manual labour in garden, field and orchard for all who are
fitted for it. Side by side with all this, lest the life of the place
grow self-centred, there must be some redemptive work going on, for
those who would not themselves have been helped by all this storehouse
of good things, apart from the mediation and ministry of its
inmates.</p>

<p>This might be found in the education of back ward or delicate
children from poor homes, physically or mentally in need of special
care and protection, or in the care of convalescents; it might be
found in the training upon the adjoining farm or in the carpenter's
workshop, as well as in special classes held within the House itself,
of a small group of lads from some reformatory, or juvenile offenders
to whom our present prison system offers only imperfect means of
succour. In helping in their training, in joining in their games the
companions of the House of Peace would find a noble part of their own
work and joy; they would hope too to share with these younger brothers
not a little of the deeper inspiration of common worship.</p>

<p>There might be as a part of the House rooms for married companions,
while single men and single women could be lodged in separate wings or
in hostels of their own. Grouped near there might be cottages with
homes linked to the House [p.142] by ties more or less close, whose
inmates would share in much of the work of the community and in the
privilege of common worship. The centre of all would be the place of
prayer, the hearth where each companion would come to rekindle his own
torch of love and aspiration; a place always open, used in common at
certain times and by all companions who were able to come there, used
also frequently throughout the day for silent prayer and meditation,
whether by the companions and their guests, or the passing stranger
who might care to enter in.</p>

<p>At least at one meal during the day the ancient practice would be
maintained of one companion reading aloud from some helpful book while
the rest kept silence. During certain hours of the day silence would
also be observed, though with no slavish bond.</p>

<p>The Buddhist monasteries of Burmah fulfil in the life of that
people a place which might, to some small extent, be taken for us by a
group of such Houses of Rest. It is the duty of every Burmese Buddhist
who desires to fulfil the whole ideal of manhood to pass some portion
of his life, it may be months or years, it may even be only weeks or
days, as a monk in a Buddhist monastery, learning its lessons and
drinking in its peace. So, too, into our House of Rest might come, at
different stages of their lives, the eager seeker after truth, the
strong man in the midst of the battle of his work, the weary, [p.143]
tired and disheartened by their failure; all would find a welcome, a
home of refreshment, where in the atmosphere of prayer, with the daily
round of simple work, of study, of open air life and common worship,
they might find guidance and renewal of strength. Some might only stay
for a short while, others for longer periods; yet others might find in
the House of Rest their central home, returning there at intervals
after periods of labour as social ministers in the crowded towns, in
which, perhaps, a number of different branches of work might be
affiliated in some way to the central House of Rest, which would be a
storehouse to supply help to these branches far away.</p>

<p>One of the rocks upon which the old monastic system made shipwreck
was the corporate selfishness which came to the monks through their
possessions. They had renounced individual wealth, but they were too
zealous to secure for their abbeys the property which might enhance
their usefulness and assure their future growth. Believing as we do
that institutions like men must die to give place to new life, we must
not try to secure an earthly immortality for a good institution, any
more than for a good individual. It would probably be best then that
our House of Rest should not be a legal corporation, able to own and
receive property. Its companions should be tenants on God's earth;
their House should be lent them in trust, but not be owned by them. It
might still, however, be possible for those who [p.144] desired for a
longer period to have the privilege of holy poverty, to renounce for
the time being their own income, without taking any vow or handing
over to the community possessions which they might rightly resume at a
later date, in trust for the world they would serve.</p>

<p>Paul Sabatier has finely said that one of the great claims which
distinguishes still the ancient Catholic Church is the unlimited
opportunity for self-sacrifice which she holds forth to her
children. We cannot get the utmost except for the highest. Our house
of prayer and of work, where self-denial might be found to the full
united with the joy of service, would give this opportunity of
self-surrender, of self-discipline untainted by false asceticism, of
comradeship in sacrifice and in the purest joys and highest
aspirations of the heart, which in the depths of our soul we need and
long for. May it not even yet be built, this House of Peace and
Prayer?</p>
<h2><a name="_CHAPTER_X.:_THE"></a> CHAPTER X.: THE PATH TO
UNITY.</h2>
<p>A GREAT patristic scholar who, though a lover of theology, is also
a lover of his fellow-men, has related how, journeying across the
lonely desert of Arabia the Rocky towards the holy monastery of Sinai,
he came upon a band of peasant pilgrims; he did not know their
language nor they his, but each made the sign of the Cross as they
drew near one another, and as they did so they seemed at once to be
friends. He was greeted with welcoming smiles, and the way through the
wilderness was lightened by the sense of Christian fellowship. It
cheered him to feel how that ancient sacred symbol had surmounted the
barriers of race and speech, making these strangers feel that they
were comrades and fellow pilgrims travelling to a common goal. And yet
he could not but recall with a sense of sorrowful irony the thought
that, had he made the sign of the Cross not in the Greek, but in the
Latin way, he would have been met with sullen indifference and
distrust, if not with anger.  These simple Russian peasants were the
spiritual descendants of the [p.146] brave men who centuries ago went
to death at the stake rather than place their fingers and thumb in the
new-fangled way, which, to their mind, symbolised some error in the
conception of the doctrine of the Trinity, a departure from the one
orthodox fashion by which the Church should be guided in making the
holy sign.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us to realise that so small a change should
make so great a difference to the welcome given to a stranger; and,
yet, perhaps some of the differences which separate Western Christians
to-day may be almost as foolish in the sight of the angels.</p>

<p>An English parson once sadly told how, when travelling in France in
his cassock, he had been delighted by a number of ecclesiastics coming
to call upon their foreign confrere, and how, to his dismay, they all
incontinently fled, as from contagion of plague, when they realised
that he was only an Anglican; he doubtless felt acutely the blindness
of the worthy Romans who failed to recognise the apostolic nature of
his orders. As acutely, perhaps, some Nonconformist minister at home
may have regretted a similar attitude on the part of the good parson
to the unhallowed ministrations of the dissenter.</p>

<p>When we look back over the long centuries that separate us from the
early Apostolic Church, there are few things which make us sadder than
this spirit of distrust and hostility, showing itself between men who
alike believe themselves to be Christians. [p.147] It is no new thing;
what is new to-day as a wide spread spirit is the desire to transcend
our differences, not by despising or ignoring the things which
separate us, nor yet by the victory of one church or sect over
another, or the absorption of the lesser by the greater community, but
by the better understanding of each other and of ourselves, the closer
co-operation where co-operation is possible, and, it may be, the
gradual realisation of a unity deeper than all that keeps us
apart.</p>

<p>We remember how the mocking scorn of Celsus made sport of the
divisions between Catholic and heretic Christians of his day, while
both alike were a persecuted minority struggling against the edicts of
pagan Rome. Montanists and orthodox suffered sometimes side by side,
and yet, while awaiting death in the same prisons, they would hold no
communion with each other.</p>

<p>This tragic mutual intolerance between Arian and Athanasian,
Iconodule and Iconoclast, goes on down the ages; was it not, in part
at least, one wonders, due to the fact that each party considered that
they alone had the monopoly of truth; that their own doctrine
contained the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  Free trade in
thought, if it be right to use the metaphor of commerce for the
life-giving intercourse of mind with mind, is late in coming in the
world's history, but it has surely come to stay.  As we look back over
the great divisions of the past, we feel now that there was some right
at least on both sides: in some [p.148] cases we find it hard to
understand how men could have fought so bitterly over what seems now
so small. The shape of the tonsure of the clergy, the date of the
celebration of Easter, and such grounds of difference, caused almost
as much bitterness in their day as did profound dissensions on the
nature of the Godhead or the meaning of the Incarnation. Even when no
theological difference separated men, within the Church itself and
within a single religious order, there has been the bitterest
disagreement and separation of spirit over things we now hold
trifling; such a matter, for instance, as the shape of the hood to be
worn by Observant Franciscans, at the time of the rise of the Capuchin
Friars.</p>

<p>We have come at length to understand that the human spirit
expresses itself in various ways in its upward striving, that the
language of worship may vary for different races, for different men
within the same race, for the individual himself with his changing
needs, and that in differing we need not always condemn each other.
So, too, it seems that men are ceasing to feel that uniformity in
Church government is possible or even desirable. The work of the Free
Church Council with all its limitations has enabled the members of the
larger Nonconformist bodies to co-operate together and understand each
other better, to feel a common unity of membership while retaining
their loyalty to their own denomination.  This drawing together has
been realised, not by discussion of [p.149] denominational
differences, but by common work and common worship, by sharing in the
same efforts, listening to the same messages of guidance, following as
co-disciples along the same road.</p>

<p>Still more remarkable as an expression of the vital forces at work
in English society is the growth of inter-denominational fellowship
shown in the Student Christian movement, and the conferences which it
has promoted, characterised by joint study of social and missionary
problems, and by union in worship, in which denominational barriers
have not indeed disappeared, but have sunk on to a lower level, for
many at least of those who have been thus drawn together to behold the
vision of the vast work still unaccomplished at home and abroad, with
the knowledge that all alike are coming for strength to one source,
striving to serve one Master.</p>

<p>While a friendlier understanding has been helping men to cross by
sympathy the ancient chasms which have separated church from church
for so long, there has been visible too in recent years a marked
tendency towards greater organic unity between religious communities
closely allied to each other. Locally this has occasionally found
expression in the springing up of "union churches," whose members
originally belonged to different Nonconformist denominations, but such
union sometimes has come about for convenience rather than from
conviction, and has not always been permanent in character. It is
different with the [p.150] union of the three Methodist Societies now
combined in the United Methodist Church, or with the great movement
which brought about the United Free Church of Scotland. We may look
forward in the near future to still further developments of this
spirit, and already a leader of Free Church thought,
Dr. J. H. Shakespeare, the Secretary of the Baptist Union, has
outlined proposals for the incorporation of the great Nonconformist
denominations in one national communion, a Free Church of England,
which would retain within its compass the different rites and systems
of Church government of its various constituent churches. This would
still leave unsolved the greater problem of the separation between the
Free Churches and the Church of England, but it would be in itself an
immense step forward as a practical recognition of common
discipleship, and as such would be welcomed warmly by many of us who,
almost certainly, would be left outside the ecclesiastical membership
of this great Free Church. The Free Church Council has already done
something to make such a union possible; and even if no formal
connection between various churches whose members are associated with
its work should be achieved, yet, in point of fact, a common member
ship is being realised by them. The great leaders of Free Church
thought and action are recognised not merely as belonging to one
denomination, but as prophets and teachers for all. The worth of their
ministry is felt even by those who cannot [p.151] recognise the
validity of their orders, because of its non-episcopal
origin.<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title= "">[32]</a></p>

<p>And yet all such plans for the promotion of visible ecclesiastical
reunion do not touch the heart of things. In earlier ages men have
sought reunion through ecclesiastical organisation and through fuller
realisation of doctrinal unity, and [p.152] have failed repeatedly in
the attempt. Can we hope to achieve union now by some ingenious scheme
of comprehensive Church Government or by the formulation of a new
creed where all the old creeds have failed to unite men?</p>

<p>Would not even the widest Church leave outside its membership
multitudes now drawing together in Adult Schools and Brotherhoods and
kindred Societies, under the inspiration of Christian influence, but
without any formal connection with the Church, and beyond them an
unknown number of men and women whose lives turn for their inspiration
to the Master whose name they reverence, but do not venture to
take?</p>

<p>Yet such men, whose life-creed is better than their thought-creed,
are a proof that discipleship is a vital relationship, involving more
than a mere emotional surrender or intellectual submission. It will
surely be in the more faithful working out of this conception of
discipleship, that Christian folk will be able to achieve that spirit
of unity which is of more value than external Reunion.</p>

<p>Wherever wrong ideals of life exist, we are coming to feel there is
a loss, not merely to the individuals immediately concerned, but to an
ever widening circle about them. We cannot acquiesce in moral failure
or divest ourselves of responsibility for it, because we ourselves
adopt a different standpoint. Much less can we consent to make a truce
with what we see is wrong in the Church to which we
belong. [p.153]</p>

<p>A sixteenth century Cardinal who was engaged in controversy with
his Protestant colleague, Odet de Coligny, found a curious consolation
for the practical failure of the Church of his day by his exposition
of a text in the Song of Solomon: "I am black but comely," was, he
held, a prophetic saying applied to the Church, black in point of
morals, comely in point of doctrine.</p>

<p>To-day, however much we may differ in doctrine, we are coming to
feel that in every failure to realise the Christian ideal of
character, the loss of each religious community is the loss of all;
wherever a Church rises to higher levels of sacrifice, or raises the
standard of its members' lives, the benefit is felt far beyond its own
borders.</p>

<p>The saints, whether canonised or uncanonised by authority, are the
common heritage of all who are striving to find their lives dominated
by the same purpose; they are a constant unifying influence throughout
the world, even though their messages differ as greatly as they often
have done in the past.</p>

<p>As the different Christian communities frankly face the unconquered
evils in the world about them, as their individual members set
themselves to wrestle against the selfish instincts in their own
lives, and to become more effective agents of peace and goodwill
amongst their neighbours and worthier citizens of the state, they will
find themselves working side by side with allies they had not hitherto
known; in extending the bounds of [p.154] knowledge and the rule of a
kindlier law, sharing the same spirit of sacrifice, facing the same
difficulties, they will be united by more than a common hope, they
will feel within them the inspiration of the same spirit.</p>

<p>If then the new spirit making for co-operation and truer
understanding of each other which is already at work amongst the
different churches is to have fuller influence, do we not need to set
out with a new enthusiasm upon the common task which awaits us at home
and abroad, and to work out together new applications of the social
teaching of the Christian Church? For many, this will come along the
lines of political and municipal action, in using what powers and
duties the law already gives us, as well as in making better laws or
claiming extended facilities for communal action.</p>

<p>But however much the powers and functions of the state may be
altered and extended, there are vast regions which must for ever lie
outside its domain: evils which laws and bye-laws cannot control,
where the mysterious forces of personality have play, and the healing
spiritual influences may work, which come with the direct contact of
goodness and unselfishness, upon the broken and bruised failures of
humanity. The state may punish wrong-doing, it may prevent particular
acts of crime, it may confine its hardened criminals within the walls
of a prison. It cannot convert them from themselves, it cannot redeem
them. The state may give pensions to old age, and make [p.155]
provision for the sick, the blind and the maimed, the epileptic, the
lunatic, the idiot and the feeble-minded. It cannot bring to these
darkened lives what most they need, the sunlight of human love and
comradeship, the healing influence of an atmosphere of prayer and of
unselfish service in which they may come themselves into touch with
the Centre and Source of this pure and cleansing stream of good.</p>

<p>This must be once again the task of the Church, as it was in the
best days of the monasteries, the guilds and confraternities of the
middle ages. We need to have a fresh Crusade, not to conquer any
far-off enemy, but against our apathy towards the social evils in our
midst. Can we not hope to see a network of new guilds and
brotherhoods, settlements, houses of peace and healing, covering the
length and breadth of the land, where men and women will sacrifice
some portion at least of their lives, giving of their work and leisure
to this task? Some will afford a shelter to the outcasts of society,
who are driven now from prison to casual ward, and from workhouse to
jail, for whom the commercial world has no use, to whom the law offers
nothing but threats and penalties: others will provide training for
boys or girls who have been committed to industrial schools, or will
offer a fresh start to those who have fallen into serious crime: there
will be some which will try to provide a home and work for the
weaklings, or those who are prevented by mental or physical defect
from [p.156] holding their own in the ordinary streams of life. Others
again will offer an asylum to sickness, helplessness and old
age. Centres of prayer, as well as centres of work, they will be the
schools of saints, where men in serving the needy in many different
ways, will all the while be brought nearer to the ultimate reunion of
Christendom and of humanity.</p>

Latin versions of the Bible seem often to have used the word
sacramentum to translate the Greek μυστήριον, thus in St. Matthew
xiii. 11, in reply to the disciples' query "Why speakest thou unto
them in parables?" is given the response "To you is given to know the
sacraments of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given"
(Cod. Bobbiensis). Even the Vulgate retains this rendering in a number
of passages (Eph. i. 9; iii. 3; v. 32; Revelation i. 20), and one
cannot help wishing that our English version might have retained so
beautiful a rendering as "the sacrament of His will," or the reference
to the mystical union of Christ and His church as "the great
sacrament." Similarly, it is interesting to hear the Vulgate speak of
"the sacrament of the seven stars," in the Apocalypse, and to read in
i Tim. iii. 16, "great is the sacrament of godliness."</p>

<p><a href="#_ednref32" name="_edn32" title="">[32]</a> It is possible
that some day this difficulty might be surmounted by the willingness
of a small group of such Free Church leaders to receive conditional
episcopal consecration at the hands of some friendly Gregorian or
Nestorian Bishops. They could then preach from the pulpit in Church or
Cathedral at the invitation of the authorities of the Church of
England, and, by receiving their episcopal orders conditionally, they
would place no stigma on their Nonconformist colleagues. The Free
Churches would then be somewhat in the position of the old Celtic
Churches before the conquest of Britain by Latin Christianity, when
Bishops did not rule by monarchial methods over fixed dioceses, but
exercised a more personal influence from their monastic homes, where
sometimes several Bishops resided together at once. We should thus
have a Free Church College of Bishops exercising authority by reason
of their personal and spiritual qualifications and seeking no other
sanction than the weight which such an influence would give.</p>

<p>There may be difficulties in the way of such a proposal, but many
Nonconformists who could not agree to accept the diocesan method of
Church government would have little or no objection to such overseers
of the Free Churches, who, holding an unpaid office, carrying no legal
privileges, would have no right to rule, but rather be recognised as
teaching, advising or pleading, with the authority of an elder brother
in the spiritual family of which they would be members. Such a simple
apostolic episcopate, strengthened from time to time by the addition
of new members called to accept their office by the voice of their
Church, might afford for those who have need of it a sign of visible
communion between the Protestant Churches and the older episcopal
churches of East and West.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
